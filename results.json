To accelerate sampling, we present denoising diffusion implicit models (DDIMs), a more efficient class of iterative implicit probabilistic models with the same training procedure as DDPMs. In DDPMs, the generative process is defined as the reverse of a Markovian diffusion process. We construct a class of non-Markovian diffusion processes that lead to the same training objective, but whose reverse process can be much faster to sample from. We empirically demonstrate that DDIMs can produce high quality samples $10 \\times$ to $50 \\times$ faster in terms of wall-clock time compared to DDPMs, allow us to trade off computation for sample quality, and can perform semantically meaningful image interpolation directly in the latent space.","publicationTitle":"arXiv:2010.02502 [cs]","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2020-10-06","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02502","accessDate":"2021-09-13T16:55:46Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"arXiv.org","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"arXiv: 2010.02502","tags":[{"tag":"Computer Science -

We present a stochastic differential equation (SDE) that smoothly transforms a complex data distribution to a known prior distribution by slowly injecting noise, and a corresponding reverse-time SDE that transforms the prior distribution back into the data distribution by slowly removing the noise. Crucially, the reverse-time SDE depends only on the time-dependent gradient field (\\aka, score) of the perturbed data distribution. By leveraging advances in score-based generative modeling, we can accurately estimate these scores with neural networks, and use numerical SDE solvers to generate samples. We show that this framework encapsulates previous approaches in score-based generative modeling and diffusion probabilistic modeling, allowing for new sampling procedures and new modeling capabilities. In particular, we introduce a predictor-corrector framework to correct errors in the evolution of the discretized reverse-time SDE. We also derive an equivalent neural ODE that samples from the same distribution as the SDE, but additionally enables exact likelihood computation, and improved sampling efficiency. In addition, we provide a new way to solve inverse problems with score-based models, as demonstrated with experiments on class-conditional generation, image inpainting, and colorization. Combined with multiple architectural improvements, we achieve record-breaking performance for unconditional image generation on CIFAR-10 with an Inception score of 9.89 and FID of 2.20, a competitive likelihood of 2.99 bits/dim, and demonstrate high fidelity generation of 1024 x 1024 images for the first time from a score-based generative model.","publicationTitle":"arXiv:2011.13456 [cs, stat]","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2021-02-10","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.13456","accessDate":"2021-06-26T16:16:48Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"arXiv.org","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"arXiv: 2011.13456","tags":[{"tag":"Computer Science - Machine Learning","type":1},{"tag":"Statistics - Machine Learning","type":1},{"tag":"read"}],"collections":["TNWL7M5C"],"relations":{"owl:sameAs":"http://zotero.org/groups/4320173/items/73KSBICK","dc:replaces":"http://zotero.org/users/7902311/items/YGD6PLK9"},"dateAdded":"2021-06-26T16:16:48Z","dateModified":"2021-09-30T17:11:27Z"}},{"key":"RF7ID2P5","version":582,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/RF7ID2P5","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/RF7ID2P5","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"creatorSummary":"Anokhin et al.","parsedDate":"2020-11-27","numChildren":6},"data":{"key":"RF7ID2P5","version":582,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Image Generators with Conditionally-Independent Pixel Synthesis","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Ivan","lastName":"Anokhin"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Kirill","lastName":"Demochkin"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Taras","lastName":"Khakhulin"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Gleb","lastName":"Sterkin"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Victor","lastName":"Lempitsky"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Denis","lastName":"Korzhenkov"}],"abstractNote":"Existing image generator networks rely heavily on spatial convolutions and, optionally, self-attention blocks in order to gradually synthesize images in a coarse-to-fine manner.

This paper describes Diffusion-Decoding models with Contrastive representations (D2C), a paradigm for training unconditional variational autoencoders (VAEs) for few-shot conditional image generation. D2C uses a learned diffusion-based prior over the latent representations to improve generation and contrastive self-supervised learning to improve representation quality. D2C can adapt to novel generation tasks conditioned on labels or manipulation constraints, by learning from as few as 100 labeled examples. On conditional generation from new labels, D2C achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art VAEs and diffusion models. On conditional image manipulation, D2C generations are two orders of magnitude faster to produce over StyleGAN2 ones and are preferred by 50% - 60% of the human evaluators in a double-blind study.","publicationTitle":"arXiv:2106.06819 [cs]","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2021-06-12","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"D2C","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.06819","accessDate":"2021-07-22T16:31:54Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"arXiv.org","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"arXiv: 2106.06819","tags":[{"tag":"Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence","type":1},{"tag":"Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","type":1},{"tag":"Computer Science - Machine Learning","type":1},{"tag":"aek"}],"collections":[],"relations":{"dc:replaces":["http://zotero.org/users/7902311/items/8LW53DI8","http://zotero.org/users/7902311/items/G5B4VQNR"],"owl:sameAs":"http://zotero.org/groups/4320173/items/766JR7U7"},"dateAdded":"2021-07-22T16:31:55Z","dateModified":"2021-09-30T17:11:26Z"}},{"key":"HSN56RWV","version":582,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/HSN56RWV","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/HSN56RWV","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"creatorSummary":"Skorokhodov et al.","parsedDate":"2020-11-24","numChildren":6},"data":{"key":"HSN56RWV","version":582,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Adversarial Generation of Continuous Images","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Ivan","lastName":"Skorokhodov"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Savva","lastName":"Ignatyev"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"Elhoseiny"}],"abstractNote":"In most existing learning systems, images are typically viewed as 2D pixel arrays. However, in another paradigm gaining popularity, a 2D image is represented as an implicit neural representation (INR) -- an MLP that predicts an RGB pixel value given its (x,y) coordinate. In this paper, we propose two novel architectural techniques for building INR-based image decoders: factorized multiplicative modulation and multi-scale INRs, and use them to build a state-of-the-art continuous image GAN. Previous attempts to adapt INRs for image generation were limited to MNIST-like datasets and do not scale to complex real-world data. Our proposed architectural design improves the performance of continuous image generators by x6-40 times and reaches FID scores of 6.27 on LSUN bedroom 256x256 and 16.32 on FFHQ 1024x1024, greatly reducing the gap between continuous image GANs and pixel-based ones. To the best of our knowledge, these are the highest reported scores for an image generator, that consists entirely of fully-connected layers. Apart from that, we explore several exciting properties of INR-based decoders, like out-of-the-box superresolution, meaningful image-space interpolation, accelerated inference of low-resolution images, an ability to extrapolate outside of image boundaries and strong geometric prior.

Though IB principle has been applied to a wide range of applications, its optimization remains a challenging problem which heavily relies on the accurate estimation of mutual information. In this paper, we present a new strategy, Variational Self-Distillation (VSD), which provides a scalable, ﬂexible and analytic solution to essentially ﬁtting the mutual information but without explicitly estimating it. Under rigorously theoretical guarantee, VSD enables the IB to grasp the intrinsic correlation between representation and label for supervised training. Furthermore, by extending VSD to multi-view learning, we introduce two other strategies, Variational Cross-Distillation (VCD) and Variational Mutual-Learning (VML), which signiﬁcantly improve the robustness of representation to viewchanges by eliminating view-speciﬁc and task-irrelevant information. To verify our theoretically grounded strategies, we apply our approaches to cross-modal person Re-ID, and conduct extensive experiments, where the superior performance against state-of-the-art methods are demonstrated. Our intriguing ﬁndings highlight the need to rethink the way to estimate mutual information.","publicationTitle":"","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"10","date":"","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Zotero","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","type":1}],"collections":[],"relations":{"dc:replaces":"http://zotero.org/users/7902311/items/RT7KAHYC","owl:sameAs":"http://zotero.org/groups/4320173/items/KVPWSBSJ"},"dateAdded":"2021-09-16T10:21:00Z","dateModified":"2021-09-30T17:11:24Z"}},{"key":"DFD78R2M","version":584,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/DFD78R2M","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/DFD78R2M","type":"text/html"},"up":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/LI4EMUQM","type":"application/json"}},"meta":{"numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"DFD78R2M","version":584,"parentItem":"LI4EMUQM","itemType":"attachment","linkMode":"imported_url","title":"arXiv.org Snapshot","accessDate":"2021-09-27T09:16:25Z","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.05931","note":"","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"2106.html","md5":"ddbc37d9f72cb9274ee559709c1958bf","mtime":1632734185000,"tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-09-27T09:16:25Z","dateModified":"2021-09-30T17:11:23Z"}},{"key":"L3VT6W76","version":584,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/L3VT6W76","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/L3VT6W76","type":"text/html"},"up":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/LI4EMUQM","type":"application/json"}},"meta":{"numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"L3VT6W76","version":584,"parentItem":"LI4EMUQM","itemType":"attachment","linkMode":"imported_url","title":"arXiv Fulltext PDF","accessDate":"2021-09-27T09:16:20Z","url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.05931.pdf","note":"","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Vahdat et al. - 2021 - Score-based Generative Modeling in Latent Space.pdf","md5":"65494f6b0ee848c2ec5d32ac74846412","mtime":1632734180000,"tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-09-27T09:16:20Z","dateModified":"2021-09-30T17:11:23Z"}},{"key":"LI4EMUQM","version":583,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/LI4EMUQM","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/LI4EMUQM","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"creatorSummary":"Vahdat et al.","parsedDate":"2021-06-10","numChildren":4},"data":{"key":"LI4EMUQM","version":583,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Score-based Generative Modeling in Latent Space","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Arash","lastName":"Vahdat"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Karsten","lastName":"Kreis"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Jan","lastName":"Kautz"}],"abstractNote":"Score-based generative models (SGMs) have recently demonstrated impressive results in terms of both sample quality and distribution coverage. However, they are usually applied directly in data space and often require thousands of network evaluations for sampling. Here, we propose the Latent Score-based Generative Model (LSGM), a novel approach that trains SGMs in a latent space, relying on the variational autoencoder framework. Moving from data to latent space allows us to train more expressive generative models, apply SGMs to non-continuous data, and learn smoother SGMs in a smaller space, resulting in fewer network evaluations and faster sampling. To enable training LSGMs end-to-end in a scalable and stable manner, we (i) introduce a new score-matching objective suitable to the LSGM setting, (ii) propose a novel parameterization of the score function that allows SGM to focus on the mismatch of the target distribution with respect to a simple Normal one, and (iii) analytically derive multiple techniques for variance reduction of the training objective. LSGM obtains a state-of-the-art FID score of 2.10 on CIFAR-10, outperforming all existing generative results on this dataset. On CelebA-HQ-256, LSGM is on a par with previous SGMs in sample quality while outperforming them in sampling time by two orders of magnitude. In modeling binary images, LSGM achieves state-of-the-art likelihood on the binarized OMNIGLOT dataset.","publicationTitle":"arXiv:2106.05931 [cs, stat]","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2021-06-10","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.05931","accessDate":"2021-09-27T05:17:53Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"arXiv.org","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"arXiv: 2106.05931","tags":[{"tag":"Computer Science -

Given an input image with user edits (e.g., hand-drawn color strokes), we first add noise to the input according to an SDE, and subsequently denoise it by simulating the reverse SDE to gradually increase its likelihood under the prior. Our method does not require task-specific loss function designs, which are critical components for recent image editing methods based on GAN inversion. Compared to conditional GANs, we do not need to collect new datasets of original and edited images for new applications. Therefore, our method can quickly adapt to various editing tasks at test time without re-training models. Our approach achieves strong performance on a wide range of applications, including image synthesis and editing guided by stroke paintings and image compositing.","publicationTitle":"arXiv:2108.01073 [cs]","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2021-08-02","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"SDEdit","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.01073","accessDate":"2021-09-30T14:55:34Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"arXiv.org","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"arXiv: 2108.01073","tags":[{"tag":"Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence","type":1},{"tag":"Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","type":1}],"collections":["TNWL7M5C"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-09-30T14:55:34Z","dateModified":"2021-09-30T14:55:34Z"}},{"key":"RNCLSN9A","version":574,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/RNCLSN9A","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/RNCLSN9A","type":"text/html"},"up":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/I49GNHEB","type":"application/json"}},"meta":{"numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"RNCLSN9A","version":574,"parentItem":"I49GNHEB","itemType":"attachment","linkMode":"imported_url","title":"arXiv.org Snapshot","accessDate":"2021-09-27T11:23:19Z","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.04958","note":"","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"1912.html","md5":"a6a130564afcc28125b3378882b99c46","mtime":1632741799000,"tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-09-27T11:23:19Z","dateModified":"2021-09-27T11:23:19Z"}},{"key":"I49GNHEB","version":573,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/I49GNHEB","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/I49GNHEB","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"creatorSummary":"Karras et al.","parsedDate":"2020-03-23","numChildren":2},"data":{"key":"I49GNHEB","version":573,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Analyzing and Improving the Image Quality of StyleGAN","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Tero","lastName":"Karras"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Samuli","lastName":"Laine"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Miika","lastName":"Aittala"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Janne","lastName":"Hellsten"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Jaakko","lastName":"Lehtinen"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Timo","lastName":"Aila"}],"abstractNote":"The style-based GAN architecture (StyleGAN) yields state-of-the-art results in data-driven unconditional generative image modeling. We expose and analyze several of its characteristic artifacts, and propose changes in both model architecture and training methods to address them. In particular, we redesign the generator normalization, revisit progressive growing, and regularize the generator to encourage good conditioning in the mapping from latent codes to images. In addition to improving image quality, this path length regularizer yields the additional benefit that the generator becomes significantly easier to invert. This makes it possible to reliably attribute a generated image to a particular network. We furthermore visualize how well the generator utilizes its output resolution, and identify a capacity problem, motivating us to train larger models for additional quality improvements. Overall, our improved model redefines the state of the art in unconditional image modeling, both in terms of existing distribution quality metrics as well as perceived image quality.","publicationTitle":"arXiv:1912.04958 [cs, eess, stat]","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2020-03-23","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.04958","accessDate":"2021-09-27T11:21:13Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"arXiv.org","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"arXiv: 1912.04958","tags":[{"tag":"Computer Science -

The original formulation, however, requires labeled data to identify the superfluous information. In this work, we extend this ability to the multi-view unsupervised setting, where two views of the same underlying entity are provided but the label is unknown. This enables us to identify superfluous information as that not shared by both views. A theoretical analysis leads to the definition of a new multi-view model that produces state-of-the-art results on the Sketchy dataset and label-limited versions of the MIR-Flickr dataset. We also extend our theory to the single-view setting by taking advantage of standard data augmentation techniques, empirically showing better generalization capabilities when compared to common unsupervised approaches for representation learning.","publicationTitle":"arXiv:2002.07017 [cs, stat]","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2020-02-18","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.07017","accessDate":"2021-09-27T08:47:30Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"arXiv.org","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"arXiv: 2002.07017","tags":[{"tag":"Computer Science - Machine Learning","type":1},{"tag":"Statistics - Machine Learning","type":1}],"collections":[],"relations":{"owl:sameAs":"http://zotero.org/groups/4320173/items/HT2HBU8C"},"dateAdded":"2021-09-27T08:47:31Z","dateModified":"2021-09-27T08:47:31Z"}},{"key":"LUS7LGRZ","version":563,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/LUS7LGRZ","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/LUS7LGRZ","type":"text/html"},"up":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/V8LURJYZ","type":"application/json"}},"meta":{"numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"LUS7LGRZ","version":563,"parentItem":"V8LURJYZ","itemType":"attachment","linkMode":"imported_url","title":"arXiv.org Snapshot","accessDate":"2021-09-27T07:54:41Z","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0004057","note":"","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"0004057.html","md5":"96bd86310885d129a8da86ccbd79faa0","mtime":1632729281000,"tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-09-27T07:54:41Z","dateModified":"2021-09-27T07:54:41Z"}},{"key":"NWT7DF4K","version":563,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/NWT7DF4K","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/NWT7DF4K","type":"text/html"},"up":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/V8LURJYZ","type":"application/json"}},"meta":{"numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"NWT7DF4K","version":563,"parentItem":"V8LURJYZ","itemType":"attachment","linkMode":"imported_url","title":"arXiv Fulltext PDF","accessDate":"2021-09-27T07:54:36Z","url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/0004057.pdf","note":"","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Tishby et al. - 2000 - The information bottleneck method.pdf","md5":"3fbadeb27543f1e17635e67fc0299f4c","mtime":1632729276000,"tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-09-27T07:54:36Z","dateModified":"2021-09-27T07:54:36Z"}},{"key":"V8LURJYZ","version":562,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/V8LURJYZ","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/V8LURJYZ","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"creatorSummary":"Tishby et al.","parsedDate":"2000-04-24","numChildren":2},"data":{"key":"V8LURJYZ","version":562,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"The information bottleneck method","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Naftali","lastName":"Tishby"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Fernando C.","lastName":"Pereira"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"William","lastName":"Bialek"}],"abstractNote":"We define the relevant information in a signal $x\\in X$ as being the information that this signal provides about another signal $y\\in \\Y$. Examples include the information that face images provide about the names of the people portrayed, or the information that speech sounds provide about the words spoken. Understanding the signal $x$ requires more than just predicting $y$, it also requires specifying which features of $\\X$ play a role in the prediction. We formalize this problem as that of finding a short code for $\\X$ that preserves the maximum information about $\\Y$. That is, we squeeze the information that $\\X$ provides about $\\Y$ through a `bottleneck' formed by a limited set of codewords $\\tX$. This constrained optimization problem can be seen as a generalization of rate distortion theory in which the distortion measure $d(x,\\x)$ emerges from the joint statistics of $\\X$ and $\\Y$. This approach yields an exact set of self consistent equations for the coding rules $X \\to \\tX$ and $\\tX \\to \\Y$. Solutions to these equations can be found by a convergent re-estimation method that generalizes the Blahut-Arimoto algorithm. Our variational principle provides a surprisingly rich framework for discussing a variety of problems in signal processing and learning, as will be described in detail elsewhere.","publicationTitle":"arXiv:physics/0004057","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2000-04-24","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0004057","accessDate":"2021-09-27T07:54:33Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"arXiv.org","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"arXiv: physics/0004057","tags":[{"tag":"Computer Science -

In the existing methods, the underline noise distribution of the diffusion process is Gaussian noise. However, fitting distributions with more degrees of freedom, could help the performance of such generative models. In this work, we investigate other types of noise distribution for the diffusion process. Specifically, we show that noise from Gamma distribution provides improved results for image and speech generation. Moreover, we show that using a mixture of Gaussian noise variables in the diffusion process improves the performance over a diffusion process that is based on a single distribution. Our approach preserves the ability to efficiently sample state in the training diffusion process while using Gamma noise and a mixture of noise.","publicationTitle":"arXiv:2106.07582 [cs, eess]","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2021-06-14","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.07582","accessDate":"2021-09-14T12:15:47Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"arXiv.org","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"arXiv: 2106.07582","tags":[{"tag":"Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","type":1},{"tag":"Computer Science - Machine Learning","type":1},{"tag":"Computer Science - Sound","type":1},{"tag":"Electrical Engineering and Systems Science - Audio and Speech Processing","type":1}],"collections":["TNWL7M5C"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-09-14T12:15:47Z","dateModified":"2021-09-14T12:16:00Z"}},{"key":"HXNUEG2D","version":539,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/HXNUEG2D","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/HXNUEG2D","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"creatorSummary":"Lam et al.","parsedDate":"2021-08-31","numChildren":2},"data":{"key":"HXNUEG2D","version":539,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Bilateral Denoising Diffusion Models","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Max W.

In this paper, we propose novel bilateral denoising diffusion models (BDDMs), which take significantly fewer steps to generate high-quality samples. From a bilateral modeling objective, BDDMs parameterize the forward and reverse processes with a score network and a scheduling network, respectively. We show that a new lower bound tighter than the standard evidence lower bound can be derived as a surrogate objective for training the two networks. In particular, BDDMs are efficient, simple-to-train, and capable of further improving any pre-trained DDPM by optimizing the inference noise schedules. Our experiments demonstrated that BDDMs can generate high-fidelity samples with as few as 3 sampling steps and produce comparable or even higher quality samples than DDPMs using 1000 steps with only 16 sampling steps (a 62x speedup).","publicationTitle":"arXiv:2108.11514 [cs, eess]","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2021-08-31","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.11514","accessDate":"2021-09-14T12:15:45Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"arXiv.org","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"arXiv: 2108.11514","tags":[{"tag":"Computer Science -

Unlike the original NeRF, which is scene specific, CodeNeRF learns to disentangle shape and texture by learning separate embeddings. At test time, given a single unposed image of an unseen object, CodeNeRF jointly estimates camera viewpoint, and shape and appearance codes via optimization. Unseen objects can be reconstructed from a single image, and then rendered from new viewpoints or their shape and texture edited by varying the latent codes. We conduct experiments on the SRN benchmark, which show that CodeNeRF generalises well to unseen objects and achieves on-par performance with methods that require known camera pose at test time. Our results on real-world images demonstrate that CodeNeRF can bridge the sim-to-real gap.

Despite its popularity in the literature, where it is often used to study memorization, generalization, and other phenomena, little is known about what DNNs learn in this setting. In this paper, we show analytically for convolutional and fully connected networks that an alignment between the principal components of network parameters and data takes place when training with random labels. We study this alignment effect by investigating neural networks pre-trained on randomly labelled image data and subsequently fine-tuned on disjoint datasets with random or real labels. We show how this alignment produces a positive transfer: networks pre-trained with random labels train faster downstream compared to training from scratch even after accounting for simple effects, such as weight scaling. We analyze how competing effects, such as specialization at later layers, may hide the positive transfer. These effects are studied in several network architectures, including VGG16 and ResNet18, on CIFAR10 and ImageNet.","publicationTitle":"arXiv:2006.10455 [cs, stat]","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2020-11-11","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.10455","accessDate":"2021-09-02T11:56:33Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"arXiv.org","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"arXiv: 2006.10455","tags":[{"tag":"Computer Science - Machine Learning","type":1},{"tag":"Statistics - Machine Learning","type":1}],"collections":[],"relations":{"owl:sameAs":"http://zotero.org/groups/4320173/items/286VVKTS"},"dateAdded":"2021-09-02T11:56:33Z","dateModified":"2021-09-02T11:56:33Z"}},{"key":"SM33CSRG","version":519,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/SM33CSRG","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/SM33CSRG","type":"text/html"},"up":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/A465FIQU","type":"application/json"}},"meta":{"numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"SM33CSRG","version":519,"parentItem":"A465FIQU","itemType":"attachment","linkMode":"imported_url","title":"arXiv.org Snapshot","accessDate":"2021-08-30T04:10:28Z","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.01285","note":"","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"2108.html","md5":"85ff4b4ce7935569356f767e94e60ce9","mtime":1630296628000,"tags":[],"relations":{"owl:sameAs":"http://zotero.org/groups/4320173/items/324MUXGD"},"dateAdded":"2021-08-30T04:10:28Z","dateModified":"2021-08-30T04:10:28Z"}},{"key":"9E492DMI","version":519,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/9E492DMI","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/9E492DMI","type":"text/html"},"up":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/A465FIQU","type":"application/json"}},"meta":{"numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"9E492DMI","version":519,"parentItem":"A465FIQU","itemType":"attachment","linkMode":"imported_url","title":"arXiv Fulltext PDF","accessDate":"2021-08-30T04:10:23Z","url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.01285.pdf","note":"","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Choi et al. - 2021 - Toward Spatially Unbiased Generative Models.pdf","md5":"07ea4e907a01bd8b4c0ec0e97d6a3619","mtime":1630296623000,"tags":[],"relations":{"owl:sameAs":"http://zotero.org/groups/4320173/items/AAF5RNFF"},"dateAdded":"2021-08-30T04:10:23Z","dateModified":"2021-08-30T04:10:23Z"}},{"key":"KD6KHEFZ","version":519,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/KD6KHEFZ","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/KD6KHEFZ","type":"text/html"},"up":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/A465FIQU","type":"application/json"}},"meta":{"numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"KD6KHEFZ","version":519,"parentItem":"A465FIQU","itemType":"note","note":"Comment: ICCV 2021","tags":[],"relations":{"owl:sameAs":"http://zotero.org/groups/4320173/items/HHSDHNMX"},"dateAdded":"2021-08-30T04:10:08Z","dateModified":"2021-08-30T04:10:08Z"}},{"key":"A465FIQU","version":519,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/A465FIQU","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/A465FIQU","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"creatorSummary":"Choi et al.","parsedDate":"2021-08-03","numChildren":3},"data":{"key":"A465FIQU","version":519,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Toward Spatially Unbiased Generative Models","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Jooyoung","lastName":"Choi"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Jungbeom","lastName":"Lee"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Yonghyun","lastName":"Jeong"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Sungroh","lastName":"Yoon"}],"abstractNote":"Recent image generation models show remarkable generation performance. However, they mirror strong location preference in datasets, which we call spatial bias. Therefore, generators render poor samples at unseen locations and scales. We argue that the generators rely on their implicit positional encoding to render spatial content. From our observations, the generator's implicit positional encoding is translation-variant, making the generator spatially biased. To address this issue, we propose injecting explicit positional encoding at each scale of the generator. By learning the spatially unbiased generator, we facilitate the robust use of generators in multiple tasks, such as GAN inversion, multi-scale generation, generation of arbitrary sizes and aspect ratios. Furthermore, we show that our method can also be applied to denoising diffusion probabilistic models.","publicationTitle":"arXiv:2108.01285 [cs]","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2021-08-03","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.01285","accessDate":"2021-08-30T04:10:08Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"arXiv.org","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"arXiv: 2108.01285","tags":[{"tag":"Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","type":1},{"tag":"Computer Science - Machine Learning","type":1}],"collections":[],"relations":{"owl:sameAs":"http://zotero.org/groups/4320173/items/3JIF7LRC"},"dateAdded":"2021-08-30T04:10:08Z","dateModified":"2021-08-30T04:10:08Z"}},{"key":"QP85W34H","version":514,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/QP85W34H","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/QP85W34H","type":"text/html"},"up":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/5TWWD7E9","type":"application/json"}},"meta":{"numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"QP85W34H","version":514,"parentItem":"5TWWD7E9","itemType":"attachment","linkMode":"imported_url","title":"arXiv.org Snapshot","accessDate":"2021-08-30T03:52:14Z","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.00630","note":"","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"2107.html","md5":"5968930dbb08b6fea11a31fa98e89672","mtime":1630295534000,"tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-08-30T03:52:14Z","dateModified":"2021-08-30T03:52:14Z"}},{"key":"W5T7FHJD","version":514,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/W5T7FHJD","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/W5T7FHJD","type":"text/html"},"up":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/5TWWD7E9","type":"application/json"}},"meta":{"numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"W5T7FHJD","version":514,"parentItem":"5TWWD7E9","itemType":"attachment","linkMode":"imported_url","title":"arXiv Fulltext PDF","accessDate":"2021-08-30T03:52:09Z","url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.00630.pdf","note":"","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Kingma et al. - 2021 - Variational Diffusion Models.pdf","md5":"e1db5b128e28fd09679739ec3464f2bb","mtime":1630295529000,"tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-08-30T03:52:09Z","dateModified":"2021-08-30T03:52:09Z"}},{"key":"5TWWD7E9","version":513,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/5TWWD7E9","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/5TWWD7E9","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"creatorSummary":"Kingma et al.","parsedDate":"2021-07-12","numChildren":2},"data":{"key":"5TWWD7E9","version":513,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Variational Diffusion Models","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Diederik P.","lastName":"Kingma"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Tim","lastName":"Salimans"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Ben","lastName":"Poole"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Jonathan","lastName":"Ho"}],"abstractNote":"Diffusion-based generative models have demonstrated a capacity for perceptually impressive synthesis, but can they also be great likelihood-based models? We answer this in the affirmative, and introduce a family of diffusion-based generative models that obtain state-of-the-art likelihoods on standard image density estimation benchmarks. Unlike other diffusion-based models, our method allows for efficient optimization of the noise schedule jointly with the rest of the model. We show that the variational lower bound (VLB) simplifies to a remarkably short expression in terms of the signal-to-noise ratio of the diffused data, thereby improving our theoretical understanding of this model class. Using this insight, we prove an equivalence between several models proposed in the literature. In addition, we show that the continuous-time VLB is invariant to the noise schedule, except for the signal-to-noise ratio at its endpoints. This enables us to learn a noise schedule that minimizes the variance of the resulting VLB estimator, leading to faster optimization. Combining these advances with architectural improvements, we obtain state-of-the-art likelihoods on image density estimation benchmarks, outperforming autoregressive models that have dominated these benchmarks for many years, with often significantly faster optimization. In addition, we show how to turn the model into a bits-back compression scheme, and demonstrate lossless compression rates close to the theoretical optimum.","publicationTitle":"arXiv:2107.00630 [cs,

flows provide a general mechanism for defining expressive probability distributions, only requiring the specification of a (usually simple) base distribution and a series of bijective transformations. There has been much recent work on normalizing flows, ranging from improving their expressive power to expanding their application. We believe the field has now matured and is in need of a unified perspective. In this review, we attempt to provide such a perspective by describing flows through the lens of probabilistic modeling and inference. We place special emphasis on the fundamental principles of flow design, and discuss foundational topics such as expressive power and computational trade-offs. We also broaden the conceptual framing of flows by relating them to more general probability transformations. Lastly, we summarize the use of flows for tasks such as generative modeling, approximate inference, and supervised learning.","publicationTitle":"arXiv:1912.02762 [cs, stat]","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2021-04-08","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02762","accessDate":"2021-08-27T05:58:02Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"arXiv.org","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"arXiv: 1912.02762","tags":[{"tag":"Computer Science - Machine Learning","type":1},{"tag":"Statistics - Machine Learning","type":1}],"collections":[],"relations":{"owl:sameAs":"http://zotero.org/groups/4320173/items/SY4F5EG6"},"dateAdded":"2021-08-27T05:58:26Z","dateModified":"2021-08-27T05:58:26Z"}},{"key":"UQ8RCWIE","version":506,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/UQ8RCWIE","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/UQ8RCWIE","type":"text/html"},"up":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/DX3FDTCL","type":"application/json"}},"meta":{"numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"UQ8RCWIE","version":506,"parentItem":"DX3FDTCL","itemType":"note","note":"Comment: Review article, 64 pages, 9 figures.

This fundamental fact is largely ignored by state-of-the-art deep learning based approaches. These methods instead train a deterministic mapping using combinations of reconstruction and adversarial losses. In this work, we therefore propose SRFlow: a normalizing flow based super-resolution method capable of learning the conditional distribution of the output given the low-resolution input. Our model is trained in a principled manner using a single loss, namely the negative log-likelihood. SRFlow therefore directly accounts for the ill-posed nature of the problem, and learns to predict diverse photo-realistic high-resolution images. Moreover, we utilize the strong image posterior learned by SRFlow to design flexible image manipulation techniques, capable of enhancing super-resolved images by, e.g., transferring content from other images. We perform extensive experiments on faces, as well as on super-resolution in general. SRFlow outperforms state-of-the-art GAN-based approaches in terms of both PSNR and perceptual quality metrics, while allowing for diversity through the exploration of the space of super-resolved solutions.","publicationTitle":"arXiv:2006.14200 [cs, eess]","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2020-07-31","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"SRFlow","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.14200","accessDate":"2021-08-26T14:46:21Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"arXiv.org","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"arXiv: 2006.14200","tags":[{"tag":"Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","type":1},{"tag":"Electrical Engineering and Systems Science - Image and Video Processing","type":1}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-08-26T14:46:21Z","dateModified":"2021-08-26T14:46:21Z"}},{"key":"A67X7MAX","version":503,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/A67X7MAX","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/A67X7MAX","type":"text/html"},"up":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/TB6I7UG4","type":"application/json"}},"meta":{"numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"A67X7MAX","version":503,"parentItem":"TB6I7UG4","itemType":"note","note":"Comment: This paper appears in: IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence On page(s): 1-16 Print ISSN: 0162-8828 Online ISSN: 0162-8828","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-08-26T14:46:06Z","dateModified":"2021-08-26T14:46:06Z"}},{"key":"TB6I7UG4","version":503,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/TB6I7UG4","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/TB6I7UG4","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"creatorSummary":"Kobyzev et al.","parsedDate":"2020","numChildren":3},"data":{"key":"TB6I7UG4","version":503,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Normalizing Flows: An Introduction and Review of Current Methods","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Ivan","lastName":"Kobyzev"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Simon J.

We show that FiLM layers are highly effective for visual reasoning - answering image-related questions which require a multi-step, high-level process - a task which has proven difficult for standard deep learning methods that do not explicitly model reasoning. Specifically, we show on visual reasoning tasks that FiLM layers 1) halve state-of-the-art error for the CLEVR benchmark, 2) modulate features in a coherent manner, 3) are robust to ablations and architectural modifications, and 4) generalize well to challenging, new data from few examples or even zero-shot.","publicationTitle":"arXiv:1709.07871 [cs, stat]","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2017-12-18","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"FiLM","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.07871","accessDate":"2021-08-23T08:10:32Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"arXiv.org","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"arXiv: 1709.07871","tags":[{"tag":"Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence","type":1},{"tag":"Computer Science - Computation and Language","type":1},{"tag":"Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","type":1},{"tag":"Statistics - Machine Learning","type":1}],"collections":[],"relations":{"owl:sameAs":["http://zotero.org/groups/4320173/items/SK233QWE","http://zotero.org/groups/4320173/items/P6ZETIVM"]},"dateAdded":"2021-08-23T08:11:21Z","dateModified":"2021-08-23T08:11:21Z"}},{"key":"ITEVK9AW","version":491,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/ITEVK9AW","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/ITEVK9AW","type":"text/html"},"up":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/DUSDVTE8","type":"application/json"}},"meta":{"numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"ITEVK9AW","version":491,"parentItem":"DUSDVTE8","itemType":"attachment","linkMode":"imported_url","title":"arXiv.org Snapshot","accessDate":"2021-08-23T08:11:14Z","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.07871","note":"","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"1709.html","md5":"029ed45d7cc266167a226741c9a97d15","mtime":1629706281000,"tags":[],"relations":{"owl:sameAs":["http://zotero.org/groups/4320173/items/YJFPIYKX","http://zotero.org/groups/4320173/items/7GYFPL8R"]},"dateAdded":"2021-08-23T08:11:21Z","dateModified":"2021-08-23T08:11:21Z"}},{"key":"AIVM53D2","version":491,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/AIVM53D2","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/AIVM53D2","type":"text/html"},"up":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/DUSDVTE8","type":"application/json"}},"meta":{"numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"AIVM53D2","version":491,"parentItem":"DUSDVTE8","itemType":"attachment","linkMode":"imported_url","title":"arXiv Fulltext PDF","accessDate":"2021-08-23T08:11:09Z","url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.07871.pdf","note":"","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Perez et al. - 2017 - FiLM Visual Reasoning with a General Conditioning.pdf","md5":"37e878eb800c806b230d26486760f22c","mtime":1629706281000,"tags":[],"relations":{"owl:sameAs":["http://zotero.org/groups/4320173/items/QSJNYRJ4","http://zotero.org/groups/4320173/items/BSINT2ZB"]},"dateAdded":"2021-08-23T08:11:21Z","dateModified":"2021-08-23T08:11:21Z"}},{"key":"6T65UBQM","version":491,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/6T65UBQM","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/6T65UBQM","type":"text/html"},"up":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/DUSDVTE8","type":"application/json"}},"meta":{"numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"6T65UBQM","version":491,"parentItem":"DUSDVTE8","itemType":"note","note":"Comment: AAAI 2018.

WaveGrad 2 is trained to estimate the gradient of the log conditional density of the waveform given a phoneme sequence. The model takes an input phoneme sequence, and through an iterative refinement process, generates an audio waveform. This contrasts to the original WaveGrad vocoder which conditions on mel-spectrogram features, generated by a separate model. The iterative refinement process starts from Gaussian noise, and through a series of refinement steps (e.g., 50 steps), progressively recovers the audio sequence. WaveGrad 2 offers a natural way to trade-off between inference speed and sample quality, through adjusting the number of refinement steps.

Most generative models rely on 2D kernels to generate images and make few assumptions about the 3D world. These models therefore tend to create blurry images or artefacts in tasks that require a strong 3D understanding, such as novel-view synthesis. HoloGAN instead learns a 3D representation of the world, and to render this representation in a realistic manner. Unlike other GANs, HoloGAN provides explicit control over the pose of generated objects through rigid-body transformations of the learnt 3D features. Our experiments show that using explicit 3D features enables HoloGAN to disentangle 3D pose and identity, which is further decomposed into shape and appearance, while still being able to generate images with similar or higher visual quality than other generative models. HoloGAN can be trained end-to-end from unlabelled 2D images only. Particularly, we do not require pose labels, 3D shapes, or multiple views of the same objects. This shows that HoloGAN is the first generative model that learns 3D representations from natural images in an entirely unsupervised manner.","publicationTitle":"arXiv:1904.01326 [cs]","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2019-10-01","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"HoloGAN","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.01326","accessDate":"2021-08-17T08:37:33Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"arXiv.org","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"arXiv: 1904.01326","tags":[{"tag":"Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","type":1}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-08-17T08:37:33Z","dateModified":"2021-08-17T08:37:33Z"}},{"key":"43B6G49X","version":477,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/43B6G49X","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/43B6G49X","type":"text/html"},"up":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/5CL67G2S","type":"application/json"}},"meta":{"numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"43B6G49X","version":477,"parentItem":"5CL67G2S","itemType":"note","note":"Comment: International Conference on Computer Vision ICCV 2019.

In contrast to previous work, we are able to do this whilst simultaneously separating foreground objects from their varying backgrounds. We achieve this via a 2-component NeRF model, FiG-NeRF, that prefers explanation of the scene as a geometrically constant background and a deformable foreground that represents the object category. We show that this method can learn accurate 3D object category models using only photometric supervision and casually captured images of the objects. Additionally, our 2-part decomposition allows the model to perform accurate and crisp amodal segmentation. We quantitatively evaluate our method with view synthesis and image fidelity metrics, using synthetic, lab-captured, and in-the-wild data. Our results demonstrate convincing 3D object category modelling that exceed the performance of existing methods.","publicationTitle":"arXiv:2104.08418 [cs]","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2021-04-16","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"FiG-NeRF","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.08418","accessDate":"2021-08-17T07:58:38Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"arXiv.org","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"arXiv: 2104.08418","tags":[{"tag":"Computer Science -

This seamless transition between optimization and Bayesian posterior sampling provides an inbuilt protection against overﬁtting. We also propose a practical method for Monte Carlo estimates of posterior statistics which monitors a “sampling threshold” and collects samples after it has been surpassed. We apply the method to three models: a mixture of Gaussians, logistic regression and ICA with natural gradients.","publicationTitle":"","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"8","date":"","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Zotero","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-07-26T08:03:37Z","dateModified":"2021-07-26T08:03:37Z"}},{"key":"MHIZINMQ","version":450,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/MHIZINMQ","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/MHIZINMQ","type":"text/html"},"up":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/CULAMFWA","type":"application/json"}},"meta":{"numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"MHIZINMQ","version":450,"parentItem":"CULAMFWA","itemType":"attachment","linkMode":"imported_url","title":"arXiv Fulltext PDF","accessDate":"2021-07-22T16:32:38Z","url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.06819.pdf","note":"","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Sinha et al. - 2021 - D2C Diffusion-Denoising Models for Few-shot Condi.pdf","md5":"257f08a74d0e3f6f1b6232bdc7511bec","mtime":1626971622000,"tags":[],"relations":{"owl:sameAs":"http://zotero.org/groups/4320173/items/JTHV3QMW"},"dateAdded":"2021-07-22T16:33:42Z","dateModified":"2021-07-26T06:53:48Z"}},{"key":"WI3LUR5M","version":451,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/WI3LUR5M","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/WI3LUR5M","type":"text/html"},"up":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/HFRNTGLQ","type":"application/json"}},"meta":{"numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"WI3LUR5M","version":451,"parentItem":"HFRNTGLQ","itemType":"attachment","linkMode":"imported_url","title":"Cheng et al. - 2019 - A Bayesian Perspective on the Deep Image Prior.pdf","accessDate":"2021-07-26T06:50:56Z","url":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/papers/Cheng_A_Bayesian_Perspective_on_the_Deep_Image_Prior_CVPR_2019_paper.pdf","note":"","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Cheng et al. - 2019 - A Bayesian Perspective on the Deep Image Prior.pdf","md5":"2c25e185ebad9b7145db8dacdd0a2f19","mtime":1627282373000,"tags":[],"relations":{"owl:sameAs":"http://zotero.org/groups/4320173/items/J9J8EY6P"},"dateAdded":"2021-07-26T06:52:53Z","dateModified":"2021-07-26T06:52:53Z"}},{"key":"HFRNTGLQ","version":450,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/HFRNTGLQ","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/HFRNTGLQ","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"creatorSummary":"Cheng et al.","parsedDate":"2019","numChildren":1},"data":{"key":"HFRNTGLQ","version":450,"itemType":"conferencePaper","title":"A Bayesian Perspective on the Deep Image Prior","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Zezhou","lastName":"Cheng"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Matheus","lastName":"Gadelha"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Subhransu","lastName":"Maji"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Sheldon"}],"abstractNote":"The deep image prior [26] was recently introduced as a prior for natural images. It represents images as the output of a convolutional network with random inputs. For “inference”, gradient descent is performed to adjust network parameters to make the output match observations. This approach yields good performance on a range of image reconstruction tasks. We show that the deep image prior is asymptotically equivalent to a stationary Gaussian process prior in the limit as the number of channels in each layer of the network goes to inﬁnity, and derive the corresponding kernel. This informs a Bayesian approach to inference. We show that by conducting posterior inference using stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics we avoid the need for early stopping, which is a drawback of the current approach, and improve results for denoising and impainting tasks. We illustrate these intuitions on a number of 1D and 2D signal reconstruction tasks.","date":"6/2019","proceedingsTitle":"2019 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)","conferenceName":"2019 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)","place":"Long Beach, CA, USA","publisher":"IEEE","volume":"","pages":"5438-5446","series":"","language":"en","DOI":"10.1109/CVPR.2019.00559","ISBN":"978-1-72813-293-8","shortTitle":"","url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8954206/","accessDate":"2021-07-26T06:51:00Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"DOI.org (Crossref)","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{"owl:sameAs":"http://zotero.org/groups/4320173/items/EH6JRM9E"},"dateAdded":"2021-07-26T06:52:53Z","dateModified":"2021-07-26T06:52:53Z"}},{"key":"6A2V5AG4","version":448,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/6A2V5AG4","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/6A2V5AG4","type":"text/html"},"up":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/Z9FIEAFE","type":"application/json"}},"meta":{"numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"6A2V5AG4","version":448,"parentItem":"Z9FIEAFE","itemType":"attachment","linkMode":"imported_url","title":"arXiv.org Snapshot","accessDate":"2021-07-26T06:51:41Z","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.07733","note":"","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"2006.html","md5":"9c45cae5fb6b6989c5aaa1bcf40d9589","mtime":1627282301000,"tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-07-26T06:51:41Z","dateModified":"2021-07-26T06:51:41Z"}},{"key":"GEKQDA8H","version":448,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/GEKQDA8H","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/GEKQDA8H","type":"text/html"},"up":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/Z9FIEAFE","type":"application/json"}},"meta":{"numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"GEKQDA8H","version":448,"parentItem":"Z9FIEAFE","itemType":"attachment","linkMode":"imported_url","title":"arXiv Fulltext PDF","accessDate":"2021-07-26T06:51:36Z","url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.07733.pdf","note":"","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Grill et al. - 2020 - Bootstrap your own latent A new approach to self-.pdf","md5":"345ce318a237747d2531d3b2b728e2b7","mtime":1627282296000,"tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-07-26T06:51:36Z","dateModified":"2021-07-26T06:51:36Z"}},{"key":"Z9FIEAFE","version":446,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/Z9FIEAFE","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/Z9FIEAFE","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"creatorSummary":"Grill et al.","parsedDate":"2020-09-10","numChildren":2},"data":{"key":"Z9FIEAFE","version":446,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Bootstrap your own latent: A new approach to self-supervised Learning","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Jean-Bastien","lastName":"Grill"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Florian","lastName":"Strub"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Florent","lastName":"Altché"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Corentin","lastName":"Tallec"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Pierre H.","lastName":"Richemond"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Elena","lastName":"Buchatskaya"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Carl","lastName":"Doersch"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Bernardo Avila","lastName":"Pires"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Zhaohan Daniel","lastName":"Guo"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Mohammad Gheshlaghi","lastName":"Azar"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Bilal","lastName":"Piot"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Koray","lastName":"Kavukcuoglu"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Rémi","lastName":"Munos"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Michal","lastName":"Valko"}],"abstractNote":"We introduce Bootstrap Your Own Latent (BYOL), a new approach to self-supervised image representation learning.

At the same time, we update the target network with a slow-moving average of the online network. While state-of-the art methods rely on negative pairs, BYOL achieves a new state of the art without them. BYOL reaches $74.3\\%$ top-1 classification accuracy on ImageNet using a linear evaluation with a ResNet-50 architecture and $79.6\\%$ with a larger ResNet. We show that BYOL performs on par or better than the current state of the art on both transfer and semi-supervised benchmarks.

Key advantages of DDPMs include ease of training, in contrast to generative adversarial networks, and speed of generation, in contrast to autoregressive models. However, DDPMs typically require hundreds-to-thousands of steps to generate a high fidelity sample, making them prohibitively expensive for high dimensional problems. Fortunately, DDPMs allow trading generation speed for sample quality through adjusting the number of refinement steps as a post process. Prior work has been successful in improving generation speed through handcrafting the time schedule by trial and error. We instead view the selection of the inference time schedules as an optimization problem, and introduce an exact dynamic programming algorithm that finds the optimal discrete time schedules for any pre-trained DDPM. Our method exploits the fact that ELBO can be decomposed into separate KL terms, and given any computation budget, discovers the time schedule that maximizes the training ELBO exactly. Our method is efficient, has no hyper-parameters of its own, and can be applied to any pre-trained DDPM with no retraining. We discover inference time schedules requiring as few as 32 refinement steps, while sacrificing less than 0.1 bits per dimension compared to the default 4,000 steps used on ImageNet 64x64 [Ho et al., 2020; Nichol and Dhariwal, 2021].","publicationTitle":"arXiv:2106.03802 [cs]","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2021-06-07","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.03802","accessDate":"2021-07-22T16:32:18Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"arXiv.org","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"arXiv: 2106.03802","tags":[{"tag":"Computer Science - Machine Learning","type":1}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-07-22T16:32:18Z","dateModified":"2021-07-22T16:32:18Z"}},{"key":"LTBUWUG5","version":437,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/LTBUWUG5","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/LTBUWUG5","type":"text/html"},"up":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/DSBTHNHU","type":"application/json"}},"meta":{"numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"LTBUWUG5","version":437,"parentItem":"DSBTHNHU","itemType":"attachment","linkMode":"imported_url","title":"Full Text","accessDate":"2021-07-22T10:14:11Z","url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.04948.pdf","note":"","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Karras et al. - 2019 - A Style-Based Generator Architecture for Generativ.pdf","md5":"b6e9e3584ef0bc24db7b2c7599192f4a","mtime":1626948851000,"tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-07-22T10:14:11Z","dateModified":"2021-07-22T10:14:11Z"}},{"key":"5A4I3GI7","version":433,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/5A4I3GI7","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/5A4I3GI7","type":"text/html"},"up":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/DSBTHNHU","type":"application/json"}},"meta":{"numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"5A4I3GI7","version":433,"parentItem":"DSBTHNHU","itemType":"note","note":"Comment: CVPR 2019 final version","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-07-22T05:42:42Z","dateModified":"2021-07-22T05:42:42Z"}},{"key":"DSBTHNHU","version":433,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/DSBTHNHU","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/DSBTHNHU","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"creatorSummary":"Karras et al.","parsedDate":"2019-03-29","numChildren":2},"data":{"key":"DSBTHNHU","version":433,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"A Style-Based Generator Architecture for Generative Adversarial Networks","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Tero","lastName":"Karras"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Samuli","lastName":"Laine"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Timo","lastName":"Aila"}],"abstractNote":"We propose an alternative generator architecture for generative adversarial networks, borrowing from style transfer literature.

In order to identify such latent dimensions for image editing, previous methods typically annotate a collection of synthesized samples and train linear classifiers in the latent space. However, they require a clear definition of the target attribute as well as the corresponding manual annotations, limiting their applications in practice. In this work, we examine the internal representation learned by GANs to reveal the underlying variation factors in an unsupervised manner. In particular, we take a closer look into the generation mechanism of GANs and further propose a closed-form factorization algorithm for latent semantic discovery by directly decomposing the pre-trained weights. With a lightning-fast implementation, our approach is capable of not only finding semantically meaningful dimensions comparably to the state-of-the-art supervised methods, but also resulting in far more versatile concepts across multiple GAN models trained on a wide range of datasets.","publicationTitle":"arXiv:2007.06600 [cs]","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2021-04-03","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.06600","accessDate":"2021-07-22T05:15:38Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"arXiv.org","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"arXiv: 2007.06600","tags":[{"tag":"Computer Science -

We propose a simple yet effective approach that is neither continuous nor implicit, challenging recent trends on view synthesis. We demonstrate that although continuous radiance field representations have gained a lot of attention due to their expressive power, our simple approach obtains comparable or even better novel view reconstruction quality comparing with state-of-the-art baselines while increasing rendering speed by over 400x. Our model is trained in a category-agnostic manner and does not require scene-specific optimization. Therefore, it is able to generalize novel view synthesis to object categories not seen during training. In addition, we show that with our simple formulation, we can use view synthesis as a self-supervision signal for efficient learning of 3D geometry without explicit 3D supervision.","publicationTitle":"","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2021/07/12","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.05775v1","accessDate":"2021-07-20T05:01:51Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"arxiv.org","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"pure"}],"collections":["CPYKW3PF"],"relations":{"owl:sameAs":"http://zotero.org/groups/4320173/items/4LPNJ4WU"},"dateAdded":"2021-07-22T04:47:34Z","dateModified":"2021-07-22T04:47:34Z"}},{"key":"VJ63H28S","version":418,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/VJ63H28S","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/VJ63H28S","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"creatorSummary":"Spezialetti et al.","parsedDate":"2019-09-15","numChildren":3},"data":{"key":"VJ63H28S","version":418,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Learning an Effective Equivariant 3D Descriptor Without Supervision","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Riccardo","lastName":"Spezialetti"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Samuele","lastName":"Salti"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Luigi","lastName":"Di Stefano"}],"abstractNote":"Establishing correspondences between 3D shapes is a fundamental task in 3D Computer Vision, typically addressed by matching local descriptors. Recently, a few attempts at applying the deep learning paradigm to the task have shown promising results. Yet, the only explored way to learn rotation invariant descriptors has been to feed neural networks with highly engineered and invariant representations provided by existing hand-crafted descriptors, a path that goes in the opposite direction of end-to-end learning from raw data so successfully deployed for 2D images. In this paper, we explore the benefits of taking a step back in the direction of end-to-end learning of 3D descriptors by disentangling the creation of a robust and distinctive rotation equivariant representation, which can be learned from unoriented input data, and the definition of a good canonical orientation, required only at test time to obtain an invariant descriptor. To this end, we leverage two recent innovations: spherical convolutional neural networks to learn an equivariant descriptor and plane folding decoders to learn without supervision. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is experimentally validated by outperforming hand-crafted and learned descriptors on a standard benchmark.","publicationTitle":"arXiv:1909.06887 [cs]","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2019-09-15","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.06887","accessDate":"2021-07-19T10:33:05Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"arXiv.org","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"arXiv: 1909.06887","tags":[{"tag":"Computer Science -

For ease of use, control should be provided via a semantically meaningful parameterization that is akin to computer animation controls. The vast majority of existing techniques do not provide such intuitive and fine-grained control, or only enable coarse editing of a single isolated control parameter. Very recently, high-quality semantically controlled editing has been demonstrated, however only on synthetically created StyleGAN images. We present the first approach for embedding real portrait images in the latent space of StyleGAN, which allows for intuitive editing of the head pose, facial expression, and scene illumination in the image. Semantic editing in parameter space is achieved based on StyleRig, a pretrained neural network that maps the control space of a 3D morphable face model to the latent space of the GAN. We design a novel hierarchical non-linear optimization problem to obtain the embedding. An identity preservation energy term allows spatially coherent edits while maintaining facial integrity. Our approach runs at interactive frame rates and thus allows the user to explore the space of possible edits. We evaluate our approach on a wide set of portrait photos, compare it to the current state of the art, and validate the effectiveness of its components in an ablation study.","publicationTitle":"arXiv:2009.09485 [cs]","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2020-09-20","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"PIE","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.09485","accessDate":"2021-07-16T08:58:35Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"arXiv.org","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"arXiv: 2009.09485","tags":[{"tag":"Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","type":1},{"tag":"Computer Science - Graphics","type":1}],"collections":[],"relations":{"dc:replaces":"http://zotero.org/users/7902311/items/I6MPCQS2"},"dateAdded":"2021-07-16T08:58:39Z","dateModified":"2021-07-17T05:01:49Z"}},{"key":"Q8TF2BKA","version":413,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/Q8TF2BKA","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/Q8TF2BKA","type":"text/html"},"up":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/74XD9YIJ","type":"application/json"}},"meta":{"numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"Q8TF2BKA","version":413,"parentItem":"74XD9YIJ","itemType":"note","note":"Comment: To appear in SIGGRAPH Asia 2020.

Therefore, we propose Latent Optimization of Hairstyles via Orthogonalization (LOHO), an optimization-based approach using GAN inversion to infill missing hair structure details in latent space during hairstyle transfer. Our approach decomposes hair into three attributes: perceptual structure, appearance, and style, and includes tailored losses to model each of these attributes independently. Furthermore, we propose two-stage optimization and gradient orthogonalization to enable disentangled latent space optimization of our hair attributes. Using LOHO for latent space manipulation, users can synthesize novel photorealistic images by manipulating hair attributes either individually or jointly, transferring the desired attributes from reference hairstyles. LOHO achieves a superior FID compared with the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) for hairstyle transfer. Additionally, LOHO preserves the subject's identity comparably well according to PSNR and SSIM when compared to SOTA image embedding pipelines.

The regions correspond to semantically relevant and distinct object parts, that are more easily detected in frames of the driving video. To force decoupling of foreground from background, we model non-object related global motion with an additional affine transformation. To facilitate animation and prevent the leakage of the shape of the driving object, we disentangle shape and pose of objects in the region space. Our model can animate a variety of objects, surpassing previous methods by a large margin on existing benchmarks.

We combine this representation with a physically-based differentiable ray marching framework that can render images from a neural reflectance field under any viewpoint and light. We demonstrate that neural reflectance fields can be estimated from images captured with a simple collocated camera-light setup, and accurately model the appearance of real-world scenes with complex geometry and reflectance. Once estimated, they can be used to render photo-realistic images under novel viewpoint and (non-collocated) lighting conditions and accurately reproduce challenging effects like specularities, shadows and occlusions. This allows us to perform high-quality view synthesis and relighting that is significantly better than previous methods. We also demonstrate that we can compose the estimated neural reflectance field of a real scene with traditional scene models and render them using standard Monte Carlo rendering engines. Our work thus enables a complete pipeline from high-quality and practical appearance acquisition to 3D scene composition and rendering.","publicationTitle":"arXiv:2008.03824 [cs]","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2020-08-16","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.03824","accessDate":"2021-07-09T14:43:26Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"arXiv.org","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"arXiv: 2008.03824","tags":[{"tag":"Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","type":1},{"tag":"Computer Science - Graphics","type":1}],"collections":["CPYKW3PF"],"relations":{"dc:replaces":"http://zotero.org/users/7902311/items/FHW6GZKG"},"dateAdded":"2021-07-09T14:43:27Z","dateModified":"2021-07-10T05:02:09Z"}},{"key":"8PG6C7E7","version":395,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/8PG6C7E7","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/8PG6C7E7","type":"text/html"},"up":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/IPMUGLKE","type":"application/json"}},"meta":{"numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"8PG6C7E7","version":395,"parentItem":"IPMUGLKE","itemType":"attachment","linkMode":"imported_url","title":"Wang et al. - One-Shot Free-View Neural Talking-Head Synthesis f.pdf","accessDate":"2021-07-06T03:19:13Z","url":"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Wang_One-Shot_Free-View_Neural_Talking-Head_Synthesis_for_Video_Conferencing_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf","note":"","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Wang et al. - One-Shot Free-View Neural Talking-Head Synthesis f.pdf","md5":"23482531849e5df50a270a33aca6dc97","mtime":1625541555000,"tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-07-06T03:19:13Z","dateModified":"2021-07-08T16:00:54Z"}},{"key":"IPMUGLKE","version":395,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/IPMUGLKE","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/IPMUGLKE","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"creatorSummary":"Wang et al.","parsedDate":"2021-04-02","numChildren":4},"data":{"key":"IPMUGLKE","version":395,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"One-Shot Free-View Neural Talking-Head Synthesis for Video Conferencing","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Ting-Chun","lastName":"Wang"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Arun","lastName":"Mallya"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Ming-Yu","lastName":"Liu"}],"abstractNote":"We propose a neural talking-head video synthesis model and demonstrate its application to video conferencing.

Moreover, our compact keypoint representation enables a video conferencing system that achieves the same visual quality as the commercial H.264 standard while only using one-tenth of the bandwidth.

Key to our approach is the transformer architecture that enables the network to learn to attend to the most relevant image frames for each 3D location in the scene, supervised only by the scene reconstruction task. Features are fused in a coarse-to-ﬁne fashion, storing ﬁne-level features only where needed, requiring lower memory storage and enabling fusion at interactive rates. The feature grid is then decoded to a higher-resolution scene reconstruction, using an MLP-based surface occupancy prediction from interpolated coarse-to-ﬁne 3D features.

Our multi-view approach addresses the problem that view synthesis methods are often limited by their depth estimation stage, where incorrect depth predictions can lead to large projection errors. To avoid this issue, we efficiently warp multiple input images into the target frame for a range of assumed depth planes. The resulting tensor representation is fed into a U-Net-like CNN with gated convolutions, which directly produces the novel output view. We therefore side-step explicit depth estimation. This improves efficiency and performance on transparent, reflective, and feature-less scene parts. FaDIV-Syn can handle both interpolation and extrapolation tasks and outperforms state-of-the-art extrapolation methods on the large-scale RealEstate10k dataset. In contrast to comparable methods, it is capable of real-time operation due to its lightweight architecture. We further demonstrate data efficiency of FaDIV-Syn by training from fewer examples as well as its generalization to higher resolutions and arbitrary depth ranges under severe depth discretization.","publicationTitle":"arXiv:2106.13139 [cs]","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2021-06-24","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"FaDIV-Syn","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.13139","accessDate":"2021-07-06T08:24:41Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"arXiv.org","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"arXiv: 2106.13139","tags":[{"tag":"Computer Science -

Do GANs learn meaningful structural parts of objects during their attempt to reproduce those objects? In this work, we test this hypothesis and propose a simple and effective approach based on GANs for semantic part segmentation that requires as few as one label example along with an unlabeled dataset. Our key idea is to leverage a trained GAN to extract pixel-wise representation from the input image and use it as feature vectors for a segmentation network. Our experiments demonstrate that GANs representation is \"readily discriminative\" and produces surprisingly good results that are comparable to those from supervised baselines trained with significantly more labels. We believe this novel repurposing of GANs underlies a new class of unsupervised representation learning that is applicable to many other tasks.

This enables the rendering of novel views of the object under arbitrary environment lighting and editing of the object's material properties. The key to our approach, which we call Neural Radiance Factorization (NeRFactor), is to distill the volumetric geometry of a Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) [Mildenhall et al. 2020] representation of the object into a surface representation and then jointly refine the geometry while solving for the spatially-varying reflectance and the environment lighting. Specifically, NeRFactor recovers 3D neural fields of surface normals, light visibility, albedo, and Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Functions (BRDFs) without any supervision, using only a re-rendering loss, simple smoothness priors, and a data-driven BRDF prior learned from real-world BRDF measurements. By explicitly modeling light visibility, NeRFactor is able to separate shadows from albedo and synthesize realistic soft or hard shadows under arbitrary lighting conditions. NeRFactor is able to recover convincing 3D models for free-viewpoint relighting in this challenging and underconstrained capture setup for both synthetic and real scenes. Qualitative and quantitative experiments show that NeRFactor outperforms classic and deep learning-based state of the art across various tasks.

We leverage a conventional structure-from-motion reconstruction to establish geometric constraints on pixels in the video. Unlike the ad-hoc priors in classical reconstruction, we use a learning-based prior, i.e., a convolutional neural network trained for single-image depth estimation. At test time, we fine-tune this network to satisfy the geometric constraints of a particular input video, while retaining its ability to synthesize plausible depth details in parts of the video that are less constrained. We show through quantitative validation that our method achieves higher accuracy and a higher degree of geometric consistency than previous monocular reconstruction methods. Visually, our results appear more stable. Our algorithm is able to handle challenging hand-held captured input videos with a moderate degree of dynamic motion. The improved quality of the reconstruction enables several applications, such as scene reconstruction and advanced video-based visual effects.","publicationTitle":"arXiv:2004.15021 [cs]","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2020-08-26","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.15021","accessDate":"2021-07-01T09:38:55Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"arXiv.org","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"arXiv: 2004.15021","tags":[{"tag":"Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","type":1}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-07-01T09:38:55Z","dateModified":"2021-07-01T09:39:00Z"}},{"key":"U7KJSRDF","version":354,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/U7KJSRDF","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/U7KJSRDF","type":"text/html"},"up":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/HFJ4ZVXS","type":"application/json"}},"meta":{"numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"U7KJSRDF","version":354,"parentItem":"HFJ4ZVXS","itemType":"note","note":"Comment: SIGGRAPH 2020.

Given an audio sequence of a source person or digital assistant, we generate a photo-realistic output video of a target person that is in sync with the audio of the source input. This audio-driven facial reenactment is driven by a deep neural network that employs a latent 3D face model space. Through the underlying 3D representation, the model inherently learns temporal stability while we leverage neural rendering to generate photo-realistic output frames. Our approach generalizes across different people, allowing us to synthesize videos of a target actor with the voice of any unknown source actor or even synthetic voices that can be generated utilizing standard text-to-speech approaches. Neural Voice Puppetry has a variety of use-cases, including audio-driven video avatars, video dubbing, and text-driven video synthesis of a talking head. We demonstrate the capabilities of our method in a series of audio- and text-based puppetry examples, including comparisons to state-of-the-art techniques and a user study.","publicationTitle":"arXiv:1912.05566 [cs]","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2020-07-29","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"Neural Voice Puppetry","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.05566","accessDate":"2021-06-29T05:15:03Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"arXiv.org","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"arXiv: 1912.05566","tags":[{"tag":"Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","type":1},{"tag":"Computer Science - Graphics","type":1}],"collections":["F2HZKCVK"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-06-29T05:15:03Z","dateModified":"2021-06-29T05:15:03Z"}},{"key":"43SSUSDX","version":329,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/43SSUSDX","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/43SSUSDX","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"creatorSummary":"Fried et al.","parsedDate":"2019-06-04","numChildren":3},"data":{"key":"43SSUSDX","version":329,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Text-based Editing of Talking-head Video","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Ohad","lastName":"Fried"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Ayush","lastName":"Tewari"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Zollhöfer"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Adam","lastName":"Finkelstein"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Eli","lastName":"Shechtman"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Dan B.","lastName":"Goldman"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Kyle","lastName":"Genova"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Zeyu","lastName":"Jin"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Theobalt"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Maneesh","lastName":"Agrawala"}],"abstractNote":"Editing talking-head video to change the speech content or to remove filler words is challenging. We propose a novel method to edit talking-head video based on its transcript to produce a realistic output video in which the dialogue of the speaker has been modified, while maintaining a seamless audio-visual flow (i.e. no jump cuts). Our method automatically annotates an input talking-head video with phonemes, visemes, 3D face pose and geometry, reflectance, expression and scene illumination per frame. To edit a video, the user has to only edit the transcript, and an optimization strategy then chooses segments of the input corpus as base material. The annotated parameters corresponding to the selected segments are seamlessly stitched together and used to produce an intermediate video representation in which the lower half of the face is rendered with a parametric face model. Finally, a recurrent video generation network transforms this representation to a photorealistic video that matches the edited transcript. We demonstrate a large variety of edits, such as the addition, removal, and alteration of words, as well as convincing language translation and full sentence synthesis.","publicationTitle":"arXiv:1906.01524 [cs]","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2019-06-04","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01524","accessDate":"2021-06-29T05:14:55Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"arXiv.org","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"arXiv: 1906.01524","tags":[{"tag":"Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","type":1},{"tag":"Computer Science - Graphics","type":1},{"tag":"Computer Science - Machine Learning","type":1}],"collections":["F2HZKCVK"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-06-29T05:14:55Z","dateModified":"2021-06-29T05:14:57Z"}},{"key":"QFX5KRBT","version":329,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/QFX5KRBT","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/QFX5KRBT","type":"text/html"},"up":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/43SSUSDX","type":"application/json"}},"meta":{"numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"QFX5KRBT","version":329,"parentItem":"43SSUSDX","itemType":"note","note":"Comment: A version with higher resolution images can be downloaded from the authors' website","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-06-29T05:14:55Z","dateModified":"2021-06-29T05:14:55Z"}},{"key":"64KR9MND","version":328,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/64KR9MND","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/64KR9MND","type":"text/html"},"up":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/VIJCJGDN","type":"application/json"}},"meta":{"numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"64KR9MND","version":328,"parentItem":"VIJCJGDN","itemType":"attachment","linkMode":"imported_url","title":"Chan and Koo - 2008 - AN INTRODUCTION TO SYNTHETIC APERTURE RADAR (SAR).pdf","accessDate":"2021-06-28T17:58:49Z","url":"https://www.jpier.org/PIERB/pierb02/03.07110101.pdf","note":"","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Chan and Koo - 2008 - AN INTRODUCTION TO SYNTHETIC APERTURE RADAR (SAR).pdf","md5":"1d8071e1dc7d266bc3a5797af90de918","mtime":1624903136000,"tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-06-28T17:58:49Z","dateModified":"2021-06-28T17:58:57Z"}},{"key":"VIJCJGDN","version":327,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/VIJCJGDN","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/VIJCJGDN","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"creatorSummary":"Chan and Koo","parsedDate":"2008","numChildren":1},"data":{"key":"VIJCJGDN","version":327,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"AN INTRODUCTION TO SYNTHETIC APERTURE RADAR (SAR)","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Yee Kit","lastName":"Chan"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Voon Chet","lastName":"Koo"}],"abstractNote":"This paper outlines basic principle of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR).

Generally, their excellent performance is imputed to their ability to learn realistic image priors from a large number of example images. In this paper, we show that, on the contrary, the structure of a generator network is sufficient to capture a great deal of low-level image statistics prior to any learning. In order to do so, we show that a randomly-initialized neural network can be used as a handcrafted prior with excellent results in standard inverse problems such as denoising, super-resolution, and inpainting. Furthermore, the same prior can be used to invert deep neural representations to diagnose them, and to restore images based on flash-no flash input pairs. Apart from its diverse applications, our approach highlights the inductive bias captured by standard generator network architectures.

For example, CS can exploit the structure of natural images and recover an image from only a few random measurements. CS is flexible and data efficient, but its application has been restricted by the strong assumption of sparsity and costly reconstruction process. A recent approach that combines CS with neural network generators has removed the constraint of sparsity, but reconstruction remains slow. Here we propose a novel framework that significantly improves both the performance and speed of signal recovery by jointly training a generator and the optimisation process for reconstruction via meta-learning. We explore training the measurements with different objectives, and derive a family of models based on minimising measurement errors. We show that Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs) can be viewed as a special case in this family of models. Borrowing insights from the CS perspective, we develop a novel way of improving GANs using gradient information from the discriminator.","publicationTitle":"arXiv:1905.06723 [cs, eess, stat]","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2019-05-18","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.06723","accessDate":"2021-06-28T16:29:34Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"arXiv.org","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"arXiv: 1905.06723","tags":[{"tag":"Computer Science - Machine Learning","type":1},{"tag":"Electrical Engineering and Systems Science - Signal Processing","type":1},{"tag":"Statistics - Machine Learning","type":1}],"collections":["QP76V5CN"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-06-28T16:29:34Z","dateModified":"2021-06-28T16:29:34Z"}},{"key":"P54CWT89","version":320,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/P54CWT89","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/P54CWT89","type":"text/html"},"up":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/Y7XUZZP9","type":"application/json"}},"meta":{"numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"P54CWT89","version":320,"parentItem":"Y7XUZZP9","itemType":"note","note":"Comment: arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1910.14634","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-06-28T16:29:29Z","dateModified":"2021-06-28T16:29:29Z"}},{"key":"Y7XUZZP9","version":320,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/Y7XUZZP9","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/Y7XUZZP9","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"creatorSummary":"Heckel and Soltanolkotabi","parsedDate":"2020-05-07","numChildren":3},"data":{"key":"Y7XUZZP9","version":320,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Compressive sensing with un-trained neural networks: Gradient descent finds the smoothest approximation","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Reinhard","lastName":"Heckel"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Mahdi","lastName":"Soltanolkotabi"}],"abstractNote":"Un-trained convolutional neural networks have emerged as highly successful tools for image recovery and restoration. They are capable of solving standard inverse problems such as denoising and compressive sensing with excellent results by simply fitting a neural network model to measurements from a single image or signal without the need for any additional training data. For some applications, this critically requires additional regularization in the form of early stopping the optimization. For signal recovery from a few measurements, however, un-trained convolutional networks have an intriguing self-regularizing property: Even though the network can perfectly fit any image, the network recovers a natural image from few measurements when trained with gradient descent until convergence. In this paper, we provide numerical evidence for this property and study it theoretically. We show that---without any further regularization---an un-trained convolutional neural network can approximately reconstruct signals and images that are sufficiently structured, from a near minimal number of random measurements.","publicationTitle":"arXiv:2005.03991 [cs, eess, stat]","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2020-05-07","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"Compressive sensing with un-trained neural networks","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.03991","accessDate":"2021-06-28T16:29:29Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"arXiv.org","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"arXiv: 2005.03991","tags":[{"tag":"Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","type":1},{"tag":"Computer Science - Machine Learning","type":1},{"tag":"Electrical Engineering and Systems Science - Image and Video Processing","type":1},{"tag":"Statistics - Machine Learning","type":1}],"collections":["QP76V5CN"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-06-28T16:29:29Z","dateModified":"2021-06-28T16:29:29Z"}},{"key":"AEZ55M4Q","version":318,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/AEZ55M4Q","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/AEZ55M4Q","type":"text/html"},"up":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/NQ87R5AB","type":"application/json"}},"meta":{"numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"AEZ55M4Q","version":318,"parentItem":"NQ87R5AB","itemType":"attachment","linkMode":"imported_file","title":"Patole and Torlak - 2013 - Two Dimensional Array Imaging With Beam Steered Da.pdf","accessDate":"","url":"","note":"","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Patole and Torlak - 2013 - Two Dimensional Array Imaging With Beam Steered Da.pdf","md5":"eb9e03e4c98772a671c710d001abed2e","mtime":1624890903000,"tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-06-28T14:34:58Z","dateModified":"2021-06-28T14:35:03Z"}},{"key":"NQ87R5AB","version":422,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/NQ87R5AB","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/NQ87R5AB","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"creatorSummary":"Patole and Torlak","parsedDate":"2013","numChildren":1},"data":{"key":"NQ87R5AB","version":422,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Two Dimensional Array Imaging With Beam Steered Data","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Sujeet","lastName":"Patole"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Murat","lastName":"Torlak"}],"abstractNote":"This paper discusses different approaches used for millimeter wave imaging of two-dimensional objects. Imaging of a two dimensional object requires reﬂected wave data to be collected across two distinct dimensions. In this paper, we propose a reconstruction method that uses narrowband waveforms along with two dimensional beam steering. The beam is steered in azimuthal and elevation direction, which forms the two distinct dimensions required for the reconstruction. The Reconstruction technique uses inverse Fourier transform along with amplitude and phase correction factors. In addition, this reconstruction technique does not require interpolation of the data in either wavenumber or spatial domain. Use of the two dimensional beam steering offers better performance in the presence of noise compared with the existing methods, such as switched array imaging system. Effects of RF impairments such as quantization of the phase of beam steering weights and timing jitter which add to phase noise, are analyzed.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","volume":"22","issue":"12","pages":"5181-5189","date":"12/2013","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"IEEE Trans. on Image Process.","language":"en","DOI":"10.1109/TIP.2013.2282115","ISSN":"1057-7149, 1941-0042","shortTitle":"","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6600891/","accessDate":"2021-06-28T14:35:02Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"DOI.org (Crossref)","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[{"tag":"psf"}],"collections":["QP76V5CN"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-06-28T14:35:02Z","dateModified":"2021-06-28T14:35:02Z"}},{"key":"ZX7SEQEG","version":316,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/ZX7SEQEG","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/ZX7SEQEG","type":"text/html"},"up":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/5KJ7MVJ5","type":"application/json"}},"meta":{"numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"ZX7SEQEG","version":316,"parentItem":"5KJ7MVJ5","itemType":"note","note":"<p>matched filter</p>","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-06-28T14:33:07Z","dateModified":"2021-06-28T14:33:12Z"}},{"key":"H428IPFC","version":314,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/H428IPFC","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/H428IPFC","type":"text/html"},"up":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/5KJ7MVJ5","type":"application/json"}},"meta":{"numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"H428IPFC","version":314,"parentItem":"5KJ7MVJ5","itemType":"note","note":"","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-06-28T14:33:06Z","dateModified":"2021-06-28T14:33:06Z"}},{"key":"XXTMIPIC","version":310,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/XXTMIPIC","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/XXTMIPIC","type":"text/html"},"up":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/2FY2I56Q","type":"application/json"}},"meta":{"numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"XXTMIPIC","version":310,"parentItem":"2FY2I56Q","itemType":"attachment","linkMode":"imported_url","title":"Snapshot","accessDate":"2021-06-28T14:28:12Z","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Weyl_expansion&oldid=1008286290","note":"","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"index.html","md5":"aeba7a091b774e7032951da60ce40975","mtime":1624890492000,"tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-06-28T14:28:12Z","dateModified":"2021-06-28T14:28:12Z"}},{"key":"2FY2I56Q","version":309,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/2FY2I56Q","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/2FY2I56Q","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"parsedDate":"2021-02-22","numChildren":1},"data":{"key":"2FY2I56Q","version":309,"itemType":"encyclopediaArticle","title":"Weyl expansion","creators":[],"abstractNote":"In physics, Weyl expansion, also known as Weyl identity or angular spectrum expansion, expresses an outgoing spherical wave as a linear combination of plane waves.

Weyl identity is largely used to characterize the reflection and transmission of spherical waves at planar interfaces; thus, it is often used to derive the Green's functions for Helmholtz equation in layered media. The expansion also covers evanescent wave components. It is often preferred to the Sommerfeld identity when the field representation is needed to be in Cartesian coordinates.The resulting Weyl integral is commonly encountered in microwave integrated circuit analysis and electromagnetic radiation over a stratified medium; as in the case for Sommerfeld integral, it is numerically evaluated. As a result, it is used in calculation of Green's functions for method of moments for such geometries. Other uses include the descriptions of dipolar emissions near surfaces in nanophotonics, holographic inverse scattering problems, Green's functions in quantum electrodynamics and acoustic or seismic waves.","encyclopediaTitle":"Wikipedia","series":"","seriesNumber":"","volume":"","numberOfVolumes":"","edition":"","place":"","publisher":"","date":"2021-02-22T15:01:55Z","pages":"","ISBN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Weyl_expansion&oldid=1008286290","accessDate":"2021-06-28T14:27:57Z","language":"en","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Wikipedia","callNumber":"","rights":"Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License","extra":"Page Version ID: 1008286290","tags":[],"collections":["QP76V5CN"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-06-28T14:27:57Z","dateModified":"2021-06-28T14:27:57Z"}},{"key":"CZREVLVP","version":303,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/CZREVLVP","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/CZREVLVP","type":"text/html"},"up":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/6E7M3H3R","type":"application/json"}},"meta":{"numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"CZREVLVP","version":303,"parentItem":"6E7M3H3R","itemType":"attachment","linkMode":"imported_url","title":"Yanik and Torlak - 2019 - Near-Field MIMO-SAR Millimeter-Wave Imaging With S.pdf","accessDate":"2021-06-28T14:02:15Z","url":"https://utd-ir.tdl.org/bitstream/handle/10735.1/7207/JECS-7171-260764.95.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y","note":"","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Yanik and Torlak - 2019 - Near-Field MIMO-SAR Millimeter-Wave Imaging With S.pdf","md5":"b5be276b6f293e2418bc50b329e032a9","mtime":1624888938000,"tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-06-28T14:02:15Z","dateModified":"2021-06-28T14:02:18Z"}},{"key":"6E7M3H3R","version":302,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/6E7M3H3R","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/6E7M3H3R","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"creatorSummary":"Yanik and Torlak","parsedDate":"2019","numChildren":1},"data":{"key":"6E7M3H3R","version":302,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Near-Field MIMO-SAR Millimeter-Wave Imaging With Sparsely Sampled Aperture Data","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Muhammet Emin","lastName":"Yanik"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Murat","lastName":"Torlak"}],"abstractNote":"The primary challenge of a cost-effective and low-complexity near-ﬁeld millimeter-wave (mmWave) imaging system is to achieve high resolution with a few antenna elements as possible. Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar using simultaneous operation of spatially diverse transmit and receive antennas is a good candidate to increase the number of available degrees of freedom. On the other hand, higher integration complexity of extremely dense transceiver electronics limits the use of MIMO only solutions within a relatively large imaging aperture. Hybrid concepts combining synthetic aperture radar (SAR) techniques and sparse MIMO arrays present a good compromise to achieve short data acquisition time and low complexity. However, compared with conventional monostatic sampling schemes, image reconstruction methods for MIMO-SAR are more complicated. In this paper, we propose a high-resolution mmWave imaging system combining 2-D MIMO arrays with SAR, along with a novel Fourier-based image reconstruction algorithm using sparsely sampled aperture data. The proposed algorithm is veriﬁed by both simulation and processing real data collected with our mmWave imager prototype utilizing commercially available 77-GHz MIMO radar sensors. The experimental results conﬁrm that our complete solution presents a strong potential in high-resolution imaging with a signiﬁcantly reduced number of antenna elements.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","volume":"7","issue":"","pages":"31801-31819","date":"2019","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"IEEE Access","language":"en","DOI":"10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2902859","ISSN":"2169-3536","shortTitle":"","url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8658136/","accessDate":"2021-06-28T14:02:17Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"DOI.org (Crossref)","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["QP76V5CN"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-06-28T14:02:17Z","dateModified":"2021-06-28T14:02:17Z"}},{"key":"5KJ7MVJ5","version":313,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/5KJ7MVJ5","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/5KJ7MVJ5","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"creatorSummary":"Yanik and Torlak","numChildren":3},"data":{"key":"5KJ7MVJ5","version":313,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Millimeter-Wave Near-Field Imaging with Two-Dimensional SAR Data","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Muhammet Emin","lastName":"Yanik"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Murat","lastName":"Torlak"}],"abstractNote":"In this paper, we present a low-cost high-resolution millimeter-wave (mmWave) imager that combines commercially available 77 GHz system-on-chip radar sensors and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) signal processing techniques.

Recently, learning-based SISR methods have greatly outperformed traditional ones, while suffering from over-smoothing, mode collapse or large model footprint issues for PSNR-oriented, GAN-driven and flow-based methods respectively. To solve these problems, we propose a novel single image super-resolution diffusion probabilistic model (SRDiff), which is the first diffusion-based model for SISR. SRDiff is optimized with a variant of the variational bound on the data likelihood and can provide diverse and realistic SR predictions by gradually transforming the Gaussian noise into a super-resolution (SR) image conditioned on an LR input through a Markov chain. In addition, we introduce residual prediction to the whole framework to speed up convergence. Our extensive experiments on facial and general benchmarks (CelebA and DIV2K datasets) show that 1) SRDiff can generate diverse SR results in rich details with state-of-the-art performance, given only one LR input; 2) SRDiff is easy to train with a small footprint; and 3) SRDiff can perform flexible image manipulation including latent space interpolation and content fusion.","publicationTitle":"arXiv:2104.14951 [cs]","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2021-05-18","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"SRDiff","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.14951","accessDate":"2021-06-26T16:33:13Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"arXiv.org","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"arXiv: 2104.14951","tags":[{"tag":"Computer Science -

A common approach to reconstruct such non-rigid scenes is through the use of a learned deformation field mapping from coordinates in each input image into a canonical template coordinate space. However, these deformation-based approaches struggle to model changes in topology, as topological changes require a discontinuity in the deformation field, but these deformation fields are necessarily continuous. We address this limitation by lifting NeRFs into a higher dimensional space, and by representing the 5D radiance field corresponding to each individual input image as a slice through this \"hyper-space\". Our method is inspired by level set methods, which model the evolution of surfaces as slices through a higher dimensional surface. We evaluate our method on two tasks: (i) interpolating smoothly between \"moments\", i.e., configurations of the scene, seen in the input images while maintaining visual plausibility, and (ii) novel-view synthesis at fixed moments. We show that our method, which we dub HyperNeRF, outperforms existing methods on both tasks by significant margins. Compared to Nerfies, HyperNeRF reduces average error rates by 8.6% for interpolation and 8.8% for novel-view synthesis, as measured by LPIPS.","publicationTitle":"arXiv:2106.13228 [cs]","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2021-06-24","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"HyperNeRF","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.13228","accessDate":"2021-06-25T18:30:30Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"arXiv.org","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"arXiv: 2106.13228","tags":[],"collections":["CPYKW3PF"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-06-25T18:30:30Z","dateModified":"2021-06-25T18:30:35Z"}},{"key":"3JSGU7NV","version":269,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/3JSGU7NV","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/3JSGU7NV","type":"text/html"},"up":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/4EKYAFYR","type":"application/json"}},"meta":{"numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"3JSGU7NV","version":269,"parentItem":"4EKYAFYR","itemType":"note","note":"Comment: Project page: https://hypernerf.github.io/","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-06-25T18:30:30Z","dateModified":"2021-06-25T18:30:30Z"}},{"key":"P45NIJ2A","version":359,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/P45NIJ2A","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/P45NIJ2A","type":"text/html"},"up":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/CYEZKAXX","type":"application/json"}},"meta":{"numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"P45NIJ2A","version":359,"parentItem":"CYEZKAXX","itemType":"attachment","linkMode":"imported_url","title":"arXiv.org Snapshot","accessDate":"2021-06-25T08:14:02Z","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.09672","note":"","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"2102.html","md5":"cd0d672ba355b90da5e69b5796f9967c","mtime":1624608842000,"tags":[],"relations":{"owl:sameAs":"http://zotero.org/groups/4320173/items/NHF3ZNW8"},"dateAdded":"2021-06-25T08:14:02Z","dateModified":"2021-06-25T08:14:02Z"}},{"key":"J4GY55HL","version":359,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/J4GY55HL","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/J4GY55HL","type":"text/html"},"up":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/CYEZKAXX","type":"application/json"}},"meta":{"numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"J4GY55HL","version":359,"parentItem":"CYEZKAXX","itemType":"attachment","linkMode":"imported_url","title":"arXiv Fulltext PDF","accessDate":"2021-06-25T08:13:58Z","url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.09672.pdf","note":"","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Nichol and Dhariwal - 2021 - Improved Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models.pdf","md5":"9badaa74e386d9400a7223c7d8567af2","mtime":1624608838000,"tags":[],"relations":{"owl:sameAs":"http://zotero.org/groups/4320173/items/DHGRCY4L"},"dateAdded":"2021-06-25T08:13:58Z","dateModified":"2021-06-25T08:13:58Z"}},{"key":"CYEZKAXX","version":359,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/CYEZKAXX","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/CYEZKAXX","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"creatorSummary":"Nichol and Dhariwal","parsedDate":"2021-02-18","numChildren":2},"data":{"key":"CYEZKAXX","version":359,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Improved Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Alex","lastName":"Nichol"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Prafulla","lastName":"Dhariwal"}],"abstractNote":"Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM) are a class of generative models which have recently been shown to produce excellent samples.

The model is built on prior work on score matching and diffusion probabilistic models. It starts from a Gaussian white noise signal and iteratively refines the signal via a gradient-based sampler conditioned on the mel-spectrogram. WaveGrad offers a natural way to trade inference speed for sample quality by adjusting the number of refinement steps, and bridges the gap between non-autoregressive and autoregressive models in terms of audio quality. We find that it can generate high fidelity audio samples using as few as six iterations. Experiments reveal WaveGrad to generate high fidelity audio, outperforming adversarial non-autoregressive baselines and matching a strong likelihood-based autoregressive baseline using fewer sequential operations.

Recently, Song et al. (2021) show that diffusion processes that transform data into noise can be reversed via learning the score function, i.e. the gradient of the log-density of the perturbed data. They propose to plug the learned score function into an inverse formula to define a generative diffusion process. Despite the empirical success, a theoretical underpinning of this procedure is still lacking. In this work, we approach the (continuous-time) generative diffusion directly and derive a variational framework for likelihood estimation, which includes continuous-time normalizing flows as a special case, and can be seen as an infinitely deep variational autoencoder. Under this framework, we show that minimizing the score-matching loss is equivalent to maximizing a lower bound of the likelihood of the plug-in reverse SDE proposed by Song et al. (2021), bridging the theoretical gap.","publicationTitle":"arXiv:2106.02808 [cs]","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2021-06-05","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.02808","accessDate":"2021-06-24T10:40:11Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"arXiv.org","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"arXiv: 2106.02808","tags":[],"collections":["TNWL7M5C"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-06-24T10:40:11Z","dateModified":"2021-06-24T10:40:14Z"}},{"key":"ILRZA9ZA","version":255,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/ILRZA9ZA","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/ILRZA9ZA","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"numChildren":1},"data":{"key":"ILRZA9ZA","version":255,"itemType":"webpage","title":"Variational Inference -

We trace the root cause to careless signal processing that causes aliasing in the generator network. Interpreting all signals in the network as continuous, we derive generally applicable, small architectural changes that guarantee that unwanted information cannot leak into the hierarchical synthesis process. The resulting networks match the FID of StyleGAN2 but differ dramatically in their internal representations, and they are fully equivariant to translation and rotation even at subpixel scales. Our results pave the way for generative models better suited for video and animation.","publicationTitle":"arXiv:2106.12423 [cs, stat]","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2021-06-23","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.12423","accessDate":"2021-06-24T08:56:28Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"arXiv.org","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"arXiv: 2106.12423","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-06-24T08:56:28Z","dateModified":"2021-06-24T08:56:28Z"}},{"key":"25VTJXL8","version":246,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/25VTJXL8","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/25VTJXL8","type":"text/html"},"up":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/AAHHRFU4","type":"application/json"}},"meta":{"numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"25VTJXL8","version":246,"parentItem":"AAHHRFU4","itemType":"attachment","linkMode":"imported_url","title":"arXiv.org Snapshot","accessDate":"2021-06-23T17:36:37Z","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.01164","note":"","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"1905.html","md5":"84638f6574b79c81fab2853ebbe712b8","mtime":1624469797000,"tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-06-23T17:36:37Z","dateModified":"2021-06-23T17:36:37Z"}},{"key":"RA5K97H8","version":246,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/RA5K97H8","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/RA5K97H8","type":"text/html"},"up":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/AAHHRFU4","type":"application/json"}},"meta":{"numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"RA5K97H8","version":246,"parentItem":"AAHHRFU4","itemType":"attachment","linkMode":"imported_url","title":"arXiv Fulltext PDF","accessDate":"2021-06-23T17:36:32Z","url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.01164.pdf","note":"","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Shaham et al. - 2019 - SinGAN Learning a Generative Model from a Single .pdf","md5":"ea2931f8d879c9a9de5888f8c67c68ed","mtime":1624469792000,"tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-06-23T17:36:32Z","dateModified":"2021-06-23T17:36:32Z"}},{"key":"AAHHRFU4","version":285,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/AAHHRFU4","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/AAHHRFU4","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"creatorSummary":"Shaham et al.","parsedDate":"2019-09-04","numChildren":3},"data":{"key":"AAHHRFU4","version":285,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"SinGAN: Learning a Generative Model from a Single Natural Image","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Tamar Rott","lastName":"Shaham"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Tali","lastName":"Dekel"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Tomer","lastName":"Michaeli"}],"abstractNote":"We introduce SinGAN, an unconditional generative model that can be learned from a single natural image. Our model is trained to capture the internal distribution of patches within the image, and is then able to generate high quality, diverse samples that carry the same visual content as the image. SinGAN contains a pyramid of fully convolutional GANs, each responsible for learning the patch distribution at a different scale of the image. This allows generating new samples of arbitrary size and aspect ratio, that have significant variability, yet maintain both the global structure and the fine textures of the training image. In contrast to previous single image GAN schemes, our approach is not limited to texture images, and is not conditional (i.e. it generates samples from noise).

In this paper, near-ﬁeld MIMO-ISAR mmWave imaging systems are discussed and developed. The rotational ISAR (R-ISAR) regime investigated in this paper requires rotating the target at a constant radial distance from the transceiver and scanning the transceiver along a vertical track. Using a 77GHz mmWave radar, a high resolution three-dimensional (3-D) image can be reconstructed from this two-dimensional scanning taking into account the spherical near-ﬁeld wavefront. While prior work in literature consists of single-input-single-output circular synthetic aperture radar (SISO-CSAR) algorithms or computationally sluggish MIMO-CSAR image reconstruction algorithms, this paper proposes a novel algorithm for efﬁcient MIMO 3-D holographic imaging and details the design of a MIMO R-ISAR imaging system. The proposed algorithm applies a multistatic-tomonostatic phase compensation to the R-ISAR regime allowing for use of highly efﬁcient monostatic algorithms. We demonstrate the algorithm’s performance in real-world imaging scenarios on a prototyped MIMO R-ISAR platform. Our fully integrated system, consisting of an mechanical scanner and efﬁcient imaging algorithm, is capable of pairing the scanning efﬁciency of the MIMO regime with the computational efﬁciency of single pixel image reconstruction algorithms.","date":"2020-9-21","proceedingsTitle":"2020 IEEE Radar Conference (RadarConf20)","conferenceName":"2020 IEEE Radar Conference (RadarConf20)","place":"Florence, Italy","publisher":"IEEE","volume":"","pages":"1-6","series":"","language":"en","DOI":"10.1109/RadarConf2043947.2020.9266412","ISBN":"978-1-72818-942-0","shortTitle":"","url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9266412/","accessDate":"2021-06-23T10:23:16Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"DOI.org (Crossref)","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["QP76V5CN"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-06-23T10:23:16Z","dateModified":"2021-06-23T10:23:16Z"}},{"key":"68TEZVFV","version":239,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/68TEZVFV","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/68TEZVFV","type":"text/html"},"up":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/K99WRYEI","type":"application/json"}},"meta":{"numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"68TEZVFV","version":239,"parentItem":"K99WRYEI","itemType":"attachment","linkMode":"imported_file","title":"Smith et al. - 2020 - Near-Field MIMO-ISAR Millimeter-Wave Imaging.pdf","accessDate":"","url":"","note":"","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Smith et al. - 2020 - Near-Field MIMO-ISAR Millimeter-Wave Imaging.pdf","md5":"cb2694d78241f912c3338f6ee84c0f5e","mtime":1624443796000,"tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-06-23T10:23:11Z","dateModified":"2021-06-23T10:23:16Z"}},{"key":"3BKWE2SR","version":236,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/3BKWE2SR","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/3BKWE2SR","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"creatorSummary":"Lin et al.","parsedDate":"2021-04-13","numChildren":2},"data":{"key":"3BKWE2SR","version":236,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"BARF: Bundle-Adjusting Neural Radiance Fields","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Chen-Hsuan","lastName":"Lin"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Wei-Chiu","lastName":"Ma"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Antonio","lastName":"Torralba"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Simon","lastName":"Lucey"}],"abstractNote":"Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have recently gained a surge of interest within the computer vision community for its power to synthesize photorealistic novel views of real-world scenes. One limitation of NeRF, however, is its requirement of accurate camera poses to learn the scene representations. In this paper, we propose Bundle-Adjusting Neural Radiance Fields (BARF) for training NeRF from imperfect (or even unknown) camera poses -- the joint problem of learning neural 3D representations and registering camera frames. We establish a theoretical connection to classical image alignment and show that coarse-to-fine registration is also applicable to NeRF. Furthermore, we show that na\\\"ively applying positional encoding in NeRF has a negative impact on registration with a synthesis-based objective. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data show that BARF can effectively optimize the neural scene representations and resolve large camera pose misalignment at the same time. This enables view synthesis and localization of video sequences from unknown camera poses, opening up new avenues for visual localization systems (e.g. SLAM) and potential applications for dense 3D mapping and reconstruction.","publicationTitle":"arXiv:2104.06405 [cs]","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2021-04-13","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"BARF","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.06405","accessDate":"2021-06-23T09:02:54Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"arXiv.org","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"arXiv: 2104.06405","tags":[{"tag":"nerf-no pose"}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-06-23T09:02:54Z","dateModified":"2021-06-23T09:04:10Z"}},{"key":"LTAMWVUW","version":235,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/LTAMWVUW","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/LTAMWVUW","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"creatorSummary":"Meng et al.","parsedDate":"2021-03-30","numChildren":2},"data":{"key":"LTAMWVUW","version":235,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"GNeRF: GAN-based Neural Radiance Field without Posed Camera","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Quan","lastName":"Meng"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Anpei","lastName":"Chen"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Haimin","lastName":"Luo"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Minye","lastName":"Wu"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Hao","lastName":"Su"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Lan","lastName":"Xu"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Xuming","lastName":"He"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Jingyi","lastName":"Yu"}],"abstractNote":"We introduce GNeRF, a framework to marry Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) with Neural Radiance Field reconstruction for the complex scenarios with unknown and even randomly initialized camera poses.

Differently, our GNeRF only utilizes randomly initialized poses for complex outside-in scenarios. We propose a novel two-phases end-to-end framework. The first phase takes the use of GANs into the new realm for coarse camera poses and radiance fields jointly optimization, while the second phase refines them with additional photometric loss. We overcome local minima using a hybrid and iterative optimization scheme. Extensive experiments on a variety of synthetic and natural scenes demonstrate the effectiveness of GNeRF. More impressively, our approach outperforms the baselines favorably in those scenes with repeated patterns or even low textures that are regarded as extremely challenging before.","publicationTitle":"arXiv:2103.15606 [cs]","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2021-03-30","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"GNeRF","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.15606","accessDate":"2021-06-20T16:04:03Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"arXiv.org","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"arXiv: 2103.15606","tags":[{"tag":"nerf-no pose"}],"collections":["CPYKW3PF"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-06-20T16:04:03Z","dateModified":"2021-06-23T09:03:44Z"}},{"key":"H2IL5GC8","version":236,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/H2IL5GC8","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/H2IL5GC8","type":"text/html"},"up":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/3BKWE2SR","type":"application/json"}},"meta":{"numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"H2IL5GC8","version":236,"parentItem":"3BKWE2SR","itemType":"attachment","linkMode":"imported_url","title":"arXiv.org Snapshot","accessDate":"2021-06-23T09:03:31Z","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.06405","note":"","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"2104.html","md5":"b13af07d5e3ad86e85e3e58e20f56377","mtime":1624439011000,"tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-06-23T09:03:31Z","dateModified":"2021-06-23T09:03:31Z"}},{"key":"TSJVNAHU","version":236,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/TSJVNAHU","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/TSJVNAHU","type":"text/html"},"up":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/3BKWE2SR","type":"application/json"}},"meta":{"numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"TSJVNAHU","version":236,"parentItem":"3BKWE2SR","itemType":"attachment","linkMode":"imported_url","title":"arXiv Fulltext PDF","accessDate":"2021-06-23T09:03:27Z","url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.06405.pdf","note":"","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Lin et al. - 2021 - BARF Bundle-Adjusting Neural Radiance Fields.pdf","md5":"e39281b24706fae556b27bcccc15001e","mtime":1624439007000,"tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-06-23T09:03:27Z","dateModified":"2021-06-23T09:03:27Z"}},{"key":"S9RRBVBF","version":235,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/S9RRBVBF","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/S9RRBVBF","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"creatorSummary":"Wang et al.","parsedDate":"2021-02-19","numChildren":3},"data":{"key":"S9RRBVBF","version":235,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"NeRF--: Neural Radiance Fields Without Known Camera Parameters","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Zirui","lastName":"Wang"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Shangzhe","lastName":"Wu"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Weidi","lastName":"Xie"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Min","lastName":"Chen"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Victor Adrian","lastName":"Prisacariu"}],"abstractNote":"This paper tackles the problem of novel view synthesis (NVS) from 2D images without known camera poses and intrinsics. Among various NVS techniques, Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) has recently gained popularity due to its remarkable synthesis quality. Existing NeRF-based approaches assume that the camera parameters associated with each input image are either directly accessible at training, or can be accurately estimated with conventional techniques based on correspondences, such as Structure-from-Motion. In this work, we propose an end-to-end framework, termed NeRF--, for training NeRF models given only RGB images, without pre-computed camera parameters. Specifically, we show that the camera parameters, including both intrinsics and extrinsics, can be automatically discovered via joint optimisation during the training of the NeRF model. On the standard LLFF benchmark, our model achieves comparable novel view synthesis results compared to the baseline trained with COLMAP pre-computed camera parameters. We also conduct extensive analyses to understand the model behaviour under different camera trajectories, and show that in scenarios where COLMAP fails, our model still produces robust results.","publicationTitle":"arXiv:2102.07064 [cs]","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2021-02-19","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"NeRF--","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.07064","accessDate":"2021-06-20T16:03:58Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"arXiv.org","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"arXiv: 2102.07064","tags":[{"tag":"nerf-no pose"}],"collections":["CPYKW3PF"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-06-20T16:03:58Z","dateModified":"2021-06-23T09:03:24Z"}},{"key":"7DTXF9QA","version":233,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/7DTXF9QA","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/7DTXF9QA","type":"text/html"},"up":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/KRKX539K","type":"application/json"}},"meta":{"numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"7DTXF9QA","version":233,"parentItem":"KRKX539K","itemType":"note","note":"<p>obsurf</p>","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-06-23T08:05:16Z","dateModified":"2021-06-23T08:05:49Z"}},{"key":"R8IQJF66","version":228,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/R8IQJF66","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/R8IQJF66","type":"text/html"},"up":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/DQHUP86T","type":"application/json"}},"meta":{"numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"R8IQJF66","version":228,"parentItem":"DQHUP86T","itemType":"note","note":"<p>pigan</p>","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-06-23T04:58:37Z","dateModified":"2021-06-23T04:58:41Z"}},{"key":"AKL6I9PK","version":225,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/AKL6I9PK","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/AKL6I9PK","type":"text/html"},"up":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/AZZC3G4L","type":"application/json"}},"meta":{"numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"AKL6I9PK","version":225,"parentItem":"AZZC3G4L","itemType":"attachment","linkMode":"imported_url","title":"arXiv.org Snapshot","accessDate":"2021-06-22T10:22:51Z","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.15055","note":"","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"2006.html","md5":"ffd9b7876f585588c4bfca0f4f4baae6","mtime":1624357371000,"tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-06-22T10:22:51Z","dateModified":"2021-06-22T10:22:51Z"}},{"key":"975CNYDP","version":225,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/975CNYDP","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/975CNYDP","type":"text/html"},"up":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/AZZC3G4L","type":"application/json"}},"meta":{"numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"975CNYDP","version":225,"parentItem":"AZZC3G4L","itemType":"attachment","linkMode":"imported_url","title":"arXiv Fulltext PDF","accessDate":"2021-06-22T10:22:28Z","url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.15055.pdf","note":"","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Locatello et al. -

Yet, most deep learning approaches learn distributed representations that do not capture the compositional properties of natural scenes. In this paper, we present the Slot Attention module, an architectural component that interfaces with perceptual representations such as the output of a convolutional neural network and produces a set of task-dependent abstract representations which we call slots. These slots are exchangeable and can bind to any object in the input by specializing through a competitive procedure over multiple rounds of attention. We empirically demonstrate that Slot Attention can extract object-centric representations that enable generalization to unseen compositions when trained on unsupervised object discovery and supervised property prediction tasks.","publicationTitle":"arXiv:2006.15055 [cs, stat]","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2020-10-14","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.15055","accessDate":"2021-06-22T10:22:10Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"arXiv.org","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"arXiv: 2006.15055","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-06-22T10:22:10Z","dateModified":"2021-06-22T10:22:10Z"}},{"key":"RKT2I7XB","version":224,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/RKT2I7XB","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/RKT2I7XB","type":"text/html"},"up":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/AZZC3G4L","type":"application/json"}},"meta":{"numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"RKT2I7XB","version":224,"parentItem":"AZZC3G4L","itemType":"note","note":"Comment: NeurIPS 2020.

A single forward pass of an encoder network outputs a set of latent vectors describing the objects in the scene. These vectors are used independently to condition a NeRF decoder, defining the geometry and appearance of each object. We make learning more computationally efficient by deriving a novel loss, which allows training NeRFs on RGB-D inputs without explicit ray marching. After confirming that the model performs equal or better than state of the art on three 2D image segmentation benchmarks, we apply it to two multi-object 3D datasets: A multiview version of CLEVR, and a novel dataset in which scenes are populated by ShapeNet models. We find that after training ObSuRF on RGB-D views of training scenes, it is capable of not only recovering the 3D geometry of a scene depicted in a single input image, but also to segment it into objects, despite receiving no supervision in that regard.","publicationTitle":"arXiv:2104.01148 [cs, stat]","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2021-04-02","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.01148","accessDate":"2021-06-22T10:14:53Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"arXiv.org","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"arXiv: 2104.01148","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-06-22T10:14:53Z","dateModified":"2021-06-22T10:14:53Z"}},{"key":"X7LQ97EN","version":221,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/X7LQ97EN","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/X7LQ97EN","type":"text/html"},"up":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/KRKX539K","type":"application/json"}},"meta":{"numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"X7LQ97EN","version":221,"parentItem":"KRKX539K","itemType":"note","note":"Comment: 15 pages, 3 figures.

In this paper, we design a \"shape curriculum\" for learning continuous Signed Distance Function (SDF) on shapes, namely Curriculum DeepSDF. Inspired by how humans learn, Curriculum DeepSDF organizes the learning task in ascending order of difficulty according to the following two criteria: surface accuracy and sample difficulty. The former considers stringency in supervising with ground truth, while the latter regards the weights of hard training samples near complex geometry and fine structure. More specifically, Curriculum DeepSDF learns to reconstruct coarse shapes at first, and then gradually increases the accuracy and focuses more on complex local details. Experimental results show that a carefully-designed curriculum leads to significantly better shape reconstructions with the same training data, training epochs and network architecture as DeepSDF. We believe that the application of shape curricula can benefit the training process of a wide variety of 3D shape representation learning methods.","publicationTitle":"arXiv:2003.08593 [cs]","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2020-07-16","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08593","accessDate":"2021-06-22T10:12:49Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"arXiv.org","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"arXiv: 2003.08593","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-06-22T10:12:49Z","dateModified":"2021-06-22T10:12:49Z"}},{"key":"4743IM4D","version":218,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/4743IM4D","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/4743IM4D","type":"text/html"},"up":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/TRKCUJS5","type":"application/json"}},"meta":{"numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"4743IM4D","version":218,"parentItem":"TRKCUJS5","itemType":"note","note":"Comment: ECCV 2020","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-06-22T10:12:49Z","dateModified":"2021-06-22T10:12:49Z"}},{"key":"FYS7UAA3","version":216,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/FYS7UAA3","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/FYS7UAA3","type":"text/html"},"up":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/9E7TRNAB","type":"application/json"}},"meta":{"numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"FYS7UAA3","version":216,"parentItem":"9E7TRNAB","itemType":"attachment","linkMode":"imported_url","title":"arXiv.org Snapshot","accessDate":"2021-06-22T09:55:23Z","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.06561","note":"","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"2106.html","md5":"38245f04078273364c89391a9df7e3ab","mtime":1624355723000,"tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-06-22T09:55:23Z","dateModified":"2021-06-22T09:55:23Z"}},{"key":"EUUMZ7DQ","version":216,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/EUUMZ7DQ","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/EUUMZ7DQ","type":"text/html"},"up":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/9E7TRNAB","type":"application/json"}},"meta":{"numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"EUUMZ7DQ","version":216,"parentItem":"9E7TRNAB","itemType":"attachment","linkMode":"imported_url","title":"arXiv Fulltext PDF","accessDate":"2021-06-22T09:55:12Z","url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.06561.pdf","note":"","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Chong and Forsyth - 2021 - GANs N' Roses Stable, Controllable, Diverse Image.pdf","md5":"81cb1c77775419f0875fea9f06e1e95e","mtime":1624355712000,"tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-06-22T09:55:12Z","dateModified":"2021-06-22T09:55:12Z"}},{"key":"9E7TRNAB","version":236,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/9E7TRNAB","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/9E7TRNAB","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"creatorSummary":"Chong and Forsyth","parsedDate":"2021-06-11","numChildren":3},"data":{"key":"9E7TRNAB","version":236,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"GANs N' Roses: Stable, Controllable, Diverse Image to Image Translation (works for videos too!)","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Min Jin","lastName":"Chong"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"David","lastName":"Forsyth"}],"abstractNote":"We show how to learn a map that takes a content code, derived from a face image, and a randomly chosen style code to an anime image. We derive an adversarial loss from our simple and effective definitions of style and content. This adversarial loss guarantees the map is diverse -- a very wide range of anime can be produced from a single content code. Under plausible assumptions, the map is not just diverse, but also correctly represents the probability of an anime, conditioned on an input face. In contrast, current multimodal generation procedures cannot capture the complex styles that appear in anime. Extensive quantitative experiments support the idea the map is correct. Extensive qualitative results show that the method can generate a much more diverse range of styles than SOTA comparisons. Finally, we show that our formalization of content and style allows us to perform video to video translation without ever training on videos.","publicationTitle":"arXiv:2106.06561 [cs]","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2021-06-11","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"GANs N' Roses","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.06561","accessDate":"2021-06-22T09:53:32Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"arXiv.org","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"arXiv: 2106.06561","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-06-22T09:53:32Z","dateModified":"2021-06-22T09:53:32Z"}},{"key":"D45SRI8J","version":214,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/D45SRI8J","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/D45SRI8J","type":"text/html"},"up":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/9E7TRNAB","type":"application/json"}},"meta":{"numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"D45SRI8J","version":214,"parentItem":"9E7TRNAB","itemType":"note","note":"Comment: code is here https://github.com/mchong6/GANsNRoses","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-06-22T09:53:32Z","dateModified":"2021-06-22T09:53:32Z"}},{"key":"YNWI67BZ","version":360,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/YNWI67BZ","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/YNWI67BZ","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"creatorSummary":"Barron et al.","parsedDate":"2021-05-06","numChildren":2},"data":{"key":"YNWI67BZ","version":360,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Mip-NeRF: A Multiscale Representation for Anti-Aliasing Neural Radiance Fields","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Jonathan T.","lastName":"Barron"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Ben","lastName":"Mildenhall"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Matthew","lastName":"Tancik"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Hedman"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Ricardo","lastName":"Martin-Brualla"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Pratul P.","lastName":"Srinivasan"}],"abstractNote":"The rendering procedure used by neural radiance fields (NeRF) samples a scene with a single ray per pixel and may therefore produce renderings that are excessively blurred or aliased when training or testing images observe scene content at different resolutions. The straightforward solution of supersampling by rendering with multiple rays per pixel is impractical for NeRF, because rendering each ray requires querying a multilayer perceptron hundreds of times. Our solution, which we call \"mip-NeRF\" (a la \"mipmap\"), extends NeRF to represent the scene at a continuously-valued scale. By efficiently rendering anti-aliased conical frustums instead of rays, mip-NeRF reduces objectionable aliasing artifacts and significantly improves NeRF's ability to represent fine details, while also being 7% faster than NeRF and half the size. Compared to NeRF, mip-NeRF reduces average error rates by 17% on the dataset presented with NeRF and by 60% on a challenging multiscale variant of that dataset that we present. Mip-NeRF is also able to match the accuracy of a brute-force supersampled NeRF on our multiscale dataset while being 22x faster.","publicationTitle":"arXiv:2103.13415 [cs]","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2021-05-06","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"Mip-NeRF","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.13415","accessDate":"2021-06-20T16:04:02Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"arXiv.org","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"arXiv: 2103.13415","tags":[],"collections":["CPYKW3PF"],"relations":{"owl:sameAs":"http://zotero.org/groups/4320173/items/C7NV4DL3"},"dateAdded":"2021-06-20T16:04:02Z","dateModified":"2021-06-22T07:00:06Z"}},{"key":"HSQJR92J","version":396,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/HSQJR92J","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/HSQJR92J","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"creatorSummary":"Lin et al.","parsedDate":"2020-12-14","numChildren":2},"data":{"key":"HSQJR92J","version":396,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Real-Time High-Resolution Background Matting","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Shanchuan","lastName":"Lin"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Andrey","lastName":"Ryabtsev"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Soumyadip","lastName":"Sengupta"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Brian","lastName":"Curless"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Steve","lastName":"Seitz"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Ira","lastName":"Kemelmacher-Shlizerman"}],"abstractNote":"We introduce a real-time, high-resolution background replacement technique which operates at 30fps in 4K resolution, and 60fps for HD on a modern GPU. Our technique is based on background matting, where an additional frame of the background is captured and used in recovering the alpha matte and the foreground layer. The main challenge is to compute a high-quality alpha matte, preserving strand-level hair details, while processing high-resolution images in real-time. To achieve this goal, we employ two neural networks; a base network computes a low-resolution result which is refined by a second network operating at high-resolution on selective patches. We introduce two largescale video and image matting datasets: VideoMatte240K and PhotoMatte13K/85. Our approach yields higher quality results compared to the previous state-of-the-art in background matting, while simultaneously yielding a dramatic boost in both speed and resolution.","publicationTitle":"arXiv:2012.07810 [cs]","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2020-12-14","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.07810","accessDate":"2021-06-22T05:53:26Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"arXiv.org","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"arXiv: 2012.07810","tags":[{"tag":"seminar"}],"collections":["F2HZKCVK"],"relations":{"owl:sameAs":"http://zotero.org/groups/4320173/items/4F7Q5SQQ"},"dateAdded":"2021-06-22T05:53:26Z","dateModified":"2021-06-22T05:54:19Z"}},{"key":"HK9ACWP3","version":396,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/HK9ACWP3","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/HK9ACWP3","type":"text/html"},"up":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/HSQJR92J","type":"application/json"}},"meta":{"numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"HK9ACWP3","version":396,"parentItem":"HSQJR92J","itemType":"attachment","linkMode":"imported_url","title":"arXiv.org Snapshot","accessDate":"2021-06-22T05:54:18Z","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.07810","note":"","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"2012.html","md5":"be8e5c74a22d08142f61a5ea8317fc4d","mtime":1624341258000,"tags":[],"relations":{"owl:sameAs":"http://zotero.org/groups/4320173/items/3ZRLE895"},"dateAdded":"2021-06-22T05:54:18Z","dateModified":"2021-06-22T05:54:18Z"}},{"key":"CSVSMXND","version":396,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/CSVSMXND","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/CSVSMXND","type":"text/html"},"up":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/HSQJR92J","type":"application/json"}},"meta":{"numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"CSVSMXND","version":396,"parentItem":"HSQJR92J","itemType":"attachment","linkMode":"imported_url","title":"arXiv Fulltext PDF","accessDate":"2021-06-22T05:54:14Z","url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.07810.pdf","note":"","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Lin et al. -

The goal of meta-learning is to train a model on a variety of learning tasks, such that it can solve new learning tasks using only a small number of training samples. In our approach, the parameters of the model are explicitly trained such that a small number of gradient steps with a small amount of training data from a new task will produce good generalization performance on that task. In effect, our method trains the model to be easy to fine-tune. We demonstrate that this approach leads to state-of-the-art performance on two few-shot image classification benchmarks, produces good results on few-shot regression, and accelerates fine-tuning for policy gradient reinforcement learning with neural network policies.","publicationTitle":"arXiv:1703.03400 [cs]","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2017-07-18","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.03400","accessDate":"2021-06-22T03:41:34Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"arXiv.org","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"arXiv: 1703.03400","tags":[],"collections":["PKH8WMHP"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-06-22T03:41:34Z","dateModified":"2021-06-22T03:41:34Z"}},{"key":"T46KFY4Y","version":191,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/T46KFY4Y","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/T46KFY4Y","type":"text/html"},"up":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/WNN73FRH","type":"application/json"}},"meta":{"numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"T46KFY4Y","version":191,"parentItem":"WNN73FRH","itemType":"note","note":"Comment: ICML 2017.

In this scenario, B acts out the role of person A, but retains his/her own personality and character.

Our method can render 800x800 images at more than 150 FPS, which is over 3000 times faster than conventional NeRFs. We do so without sacrificing quality while preserving the ability of NeRFs to perform free-viewpoint rendering of scenes with arbitrary geometry and view-dependent effects. Real-time performance is achieved by pre-tabulating the NeRF into a PlenOctree. In order to preserve view-dependent effects such as specularities, we factorize the appearance via closed-form spherical basis functions. Specifically, we show that it is possible to train NeRFs to predict a spherical harmonic representation of radiance, removing the viewing direction as an input to the neural network. Furthermore, we show that PlenOctrees can be directly optimized to further minimize the reconstruction loss, which leads to equal or better quality compared to competing methods. Moreover, this octree optimization step can be used to reduce the training time, as we no longer need to wait for the NeRF training to converge fully. Our real-time neural rendering approach may potentially enable new applications such as 6-DOF industrial and product visualizations, as well as next generation AR/VR systems.

However, NeRF requires querying a deep Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) millions of times, leading to slow rendering times, even on modern GPUs. In this paper, we demonstrate that significant speed-ups are possible by utilizing thousands of tiny MLPs instead of one single large MLP. In our setting, each individual MLP only needs to represent parts of the scene, thus smaller and faster-to-evaluate MLPs can be used. By combining this divide-and-conquer strategy with further optimizations, rendering is accelerated by two orders of magnitude compared to the original NeRF model without incurring high storage costs. Further, using teacher-student distillation for training, we show that this speed-up can be achieved without sacrificing visual quality.","publicationTitle":"arXiv:2103.13744 [cs]","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2021-03-25","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"KiloNeRF","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.13744","accessDate":"2021-06-20T16:04:03Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"arXiv.org","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"arXiv: 2103.13744","tags":[{"tag":"nerf"},{"tag":"real-time"}],"collections":["8CLBFGR2","CPYKW3PF"],"relations":{"owl:sameAs":"http://zotero.org/groups/4320173/items/B3M6EGUK"},"dateAdded":"2021-06-20T16:04:04Z","dateModified":"2021-06-20T16:46:57Z"}},{"key":"RNT8QSRD","version":104,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/RNT8QSRD","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/RNT8QSRD","type":"text/html"},"up":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/SEIXRRIR","type":"application/json"}},"meta":{"numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"RNT8QSRD","version":104,"parentItem":"SEIXRRIR","itemType":"attachment","linkMode":"imported_url","title":"arXiv.org Snapshot","accessDate":"2021-06-20T16:44:07Z","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.05233","note":"","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"2105.html","md5":"7fd1bea8f3d8ded5387e124d2c9ba9e8","mtime":1624207447000,"tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-06-20T16:44:07Z","dateModified":"2021-06-20T16:44:07Z"}},{"key":"GUCCBNJF","version":104,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/GUCCBNJF","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/GUCCBNJF","type":"text/html"},"up":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/SEIXRRIR","type":"application/json"}},"meta":{"numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"GUCCBNJF","version":104,"parentItem":"SEIXRRIR","itemType":"attachment","linkMode":"imported_url","title":"arXiv Fulltext PDF","accessDate":"2021-06-20T16:44:03Z","url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.05233.pdf","note":"","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Dhariwal and Nichol -

We introduce a stochastic variational inference and learning algorithm that scales to large datasets and, under some mild differentiability conditions, even works in the intractable case. Our contributions is two-fold. First, we show that a reparameterization of the variational lower bound yields a lower bound estimator that can be straightforwardly optimized using standard stochastic gradient methods. Second, we show that for i.i.d. datasets with continuous latent variables per datapoint, posterior inference can be made especially efficient by fitting an approximate inference model (also called a recognition model) to the intractable posterior using the proposed lower bound estimator. Theoretical advantages are reflected in experimental results.","publicationTitle":"arXiv:1312.6114 [cs, stat]","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2014-05-01","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6114","accessDate":"2021-06-20T16:38:23Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"arXiv.org","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"arXiv: 1312.6114","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-06-20T16:38:23Z","dateModified":"2021-06-20T16:40:30Z"}},{"key":"UVJFD2EP","version":102,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/UVJFD2EP","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/UVJFD2EP","type":"text/html"},"up":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/C3MDVZBZ","type":"application/json"}},"meta":{"numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"UVJFD2EP","version":102,"parentItem":"C3MDVZBZ","itemType":"attachment","linkMode":"imported_url","title":"arXiv.org Snapshot","accessDate":"2021-06-20T16:40:29Z","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6114","note":"","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"1312.html","md5":"4430c944ef5e744637c61374b1fa8409","mtime":1624207229000,"tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-06-20T16:40:29Z","dateModified":"2021-06-20T16:40:29Z"}},{"key":"TBPDF5RX","version":102,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/TBPDF5RX","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/TBPDF5RX","type":"text/html"},"up":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/C3MDVZBZ","type":"application/json"}},"meta":{"numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"TBPDF5RX","version":102,"parentItem":"C3MDVZBZ","itemType":"attachment","linkMode":"imported_url","title":"arXiv Fulltext PDF","accessDate":"2021-06-20T16:40:25Z","url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.6114.pdf","note":"","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Kingma and Welling -

Neural rendering techniques have recently achieved photorealistic image quality for this task. State-of-the-art (SOTA) neural volume rendering approaches, however, are slow to train and require minutes of inference (i.e., rendering) time for high image resolutions. We adopt high-capacity neural scene representations with periodic activations for jointly optimizing an implicit surface and a radiance ﬁeld of a scene supervised exclusively with posed 2D images. Our neural rendering pipeline accelerates SOTA neural volume rendering by about two orders of magnitude and our implicit surface representation is unique in allowing us to export a mesh with view-dependent texture information. Thus, like other implicit surface representations, ours is compatible with traditional graphics pipelines, enabling real-time rendering rates, while achieving unprecedented image quality compared to other surface methods. We assess the quality of our approach using existing datasets as well as high-quality 3D face data captured with a custom multi-camera rig.","publicationTitle":"","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"11","date":"","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"","accessDate":"","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"Zotero","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-06-20T16:37:26Z","dateModified":"2021-06-20T16:37:26Z"}},{"key":"ARKAQYWH","version":98,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/ARKAQYWH","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/ARKAQYWH","type":"text/html"},"up":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/IWDM4ZF5","type":"application/json"}},"meta":{"numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"ARKAQYWH","version":98,"parentItem":"IWDM4ZF5","itemType":"attachment","linkMode":"imported_url","title":"arXiv.org Snapshot","accessDate":"2021-06-20T16:37:21Z","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.09955","note":"","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"2012.html","md5":"96c09b5a8be9bf6bb0551e3cec6834ee","mtime":1624207041000,"tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-06-20T16:37:21Z","dateModified":"2021-06-20T16:37:21Z"}},{"key":"EIXF8LLF","version":98,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/EIXF8LLF","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/EIXF8LLF","type":"text/html"},"up":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/IWDM4ZF5","type":"application/json"}},"meta":{"numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"EIXF8LLF","version":98,"parentItem":"IWDM4ZF5","itemType":"attachment","linkMode":"imported_url","title":"arXiv Fulltext PDF","accessDate":"2021-06-20T16:37:16Z","url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.09955.pdf","note":"","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Wang et al. -

Our method does not rely on a regular arrangement of input views, can synthesize images for free camera movement through the scene, and works for general scenes with unconstrained geometric layouts. We calibrate the input images via SfM and erect a coarse geometric scaﬀold via MVS. This scaﬀold is used to create a proxy depth map for a novel view of the scene. Based on this depth map, a recurrent encoder-decoder network processes reprojected features from nearby views and synthesizes the new view. Our network does not need to be optimized for a given scene. After training on a dataset, it works in previously unseen environments with no ﬁnetuning or per-scene optimization. We evaluate the presented approach on challenging real-world datasets, including Tanks and Temples, where we demonstrate successful view synthesis for the ﬁrst time and substantially outperform prior and concurrent work.","date":"2020","proceedingsTitle":"Computer Vision – ECCV 2020","conferenceName":"","place":"Cham","publisher":"Springer International Publishing","volume":"12364","pages":"623-640","series":"","language":"en","DOI":"","ISBN":"978-3-030-58528-0 978-3-030-58529-7","shortTitle":"","url":"https://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-030-58529-7_37","accessDate":"2021-06-20T16:35:45Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"DOI.org (Crossref)","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"Series Title: Lecture Notes in Computer Science\nDOI: 10.1007/978-3-030-58529-7_37","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-06-20T16:35:45Z","dateModified":"2021-06-20T16:36:24Z"}},{"key":"Z7HJI4Z7","version":97,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/Z7HJI4Z7","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/Z7HJI4Z7","type":"text/html"},"up":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/9YFDKDRF","type":"application/json"}},"meta":{"numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"Z7HJI4Z7","version":97,"parentItem":"9YFDKDRF","itemType":"attachment","linkMode":"imported_url","title":"arXiv.org Snapshot","accessDate":"2021-06-20T16:36:03Z","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.09854","note":"","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"2012.html","md5":"8b5891d536a08c1ddecba5a18f9333dd","mtime":1624206963000,"tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-06-20T16:36:03Z","dateModified":"2021-06-20T16:36:03Z"}},{"key":"U28HUXCI","version":97,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/U28HUXCI","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/U28HUXCI","type":"text/html"},"up":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/VYTC7KJ6","type":"application/json"}},"meta":{"numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"U28HUXCI","version":97,"parentItem":"VYTC7KJ6","itemType":"attachment","linkMode":"imported_url","title":"arXiv.org Snapshot","accessDate":"2021-06-20T16:36:00Z","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.09855","note":"","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"2012.html","md5":"f978e19563585c415b285375bf3043c2","mtime":1624206960000,"tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-06-20T16:36:00Z","dateModified":"2021-06-20T16:36:00Z"}},{"key":"GFT5LQQ2","version":97,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/GFT5LQQ2","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/GFT5LQQ2","type":"text/html"},"up":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/9YFDKDRF","type":"application/json"}},"meta":{"numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"GFT5LQQ2","version":97,"parentItem":"9YFDKDRF","itemType":"attachment","linkMode":"imported_url","title":"arXiv Fulltext PDF","accessDate":"2021-06-20T16:35:58Z","url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.09854.pdf","note":"","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Hu et al. -

These techniques were derived from microwave holography techniques that utilize phase and amplitude information recorded over a two-dimensional aperture to reconstruct a focused image of the target. Millimeter-wave imaging is well suited for the detection of concealed weapons or other contraband carried on personnel since millimeter-waves are nonionizing, readily penetrate common clothing material, and are reflected from the human body and any concealed items. In this paper, a wide-bandwidth three-dimensional holographic microwave imaging technique is described. Practical weapon detection systems for airport or other high-throughput applications require high-speed scanning on the order of 3 to 10 s. To achieve this goal, a prototype imaging system utilizing a 27–33 GHz linear sequentially switched array and a high-speed linear scanner has been developed and tested. This system is described in detail along with numerous imaging results.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","volume":"49","issue":"9","pages":"1581-1592","date":"Sept./2001","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"IEEE Trans.

As a result, there is a strong desire to exploit the progress in mmWave sensors in wide range of imaging applications including medical, automotive, and security. In this paper, we present a low-cost high-resolution mmWave imager prototype that combines commercially available 77 GHz system-on-chip FMCW radar sensors and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) signal processing techniques for concealed item detection. To create a synthetic aperture over a target scene, the imager is constructed with a two-axis motorized rail system which can synthesize a large aperture in both horizontal and vertical directions. Our prototype system is described in detail along with signal processing techniques for two-dimensional (2-D) image reconstruction. The imaging examples of concealed items in various scenarios conﬁrm that our low-cost prototype has a great potential for high-resolution imaging tasks in security applications.","date":"1/2019","proceedingsTitle":"2019 IEEE Radio and Wireless Symposium (RWS)","conferenceName":"2019 IEEE Radio and Wireless Symposium (RWS)","place":"Orlando, FL, USA","publisher":"IEEE","volume":"","pages":"1-4","series":"","language":"en","DOI":"10.1109/RWS.2019.8714552","ISBN":"978-1-5386-5944-1","shortTitle":"","url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8714552/","accessDate":"2021-06-20T16:30:09Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"DOI.org (Crossref)","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"","tags":[],"collections":["QP76V5CN"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-06-20T16:30:09Z","dateModified":"2021-06-20T16:30:14Z"}},{"key":"2MCHWYYP","version":362,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/2MCHWYYP","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/2MCHWYYP","type":"text/html"},"up":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/86AX9V9R","type":"application/json"}},"meta":{"numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"2MCHWYYP","version":362,"parentItem":"86AX9V9R","itemType":"attachment","linkMode":"imported_url","title":"arXiv.org Snapshot","accessDate":"2021-06-20T16:30:00Z","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.11571","note":"","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"2007.html","md5":"e03a515cda922e2dca33244b512a3d9d","mtime":1624206600000,"tags":[],"relations":{"owl:sameAs":"http://zotero.org/groups/4320173/items/V5S3G9UE"},"dateAdded":"2021-06-20T16:30:00Z","dateModified":"2021-06-20T16:30:00Z"}},{"key":"359EK8W8","version":362,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/359EK8W8","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/359EK8W8","type":"text/html"},"up":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/86AX9V9R","type":"application/json"}},"meta":{"numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"359EK8W8","version":362,"parentItem":"86AX9V9R","itemType":"attachment","linkMode":"imported_url","title":"arXiv Fulltext PDF","accessDate":"2021-06-20T16:29:55Z","url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.11571.pdf","note":"","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Liu et al. -

The existing approach for constructing neural radiance fields involves optimizing the representation to every scene independently, requiring many calibrated views and significant compute time. We take a step towards resolving these shortcomings by introducing an architecture that conditions a NeRF on image inputs in a fully convolutional manner. This allows the network to be trained across multiple scenes to learn a scene prior, enabling it to perform novel view synthesis in a feed-forward manner from a sparse set of views (as few as one). Leveraging the volume rendering approach of NeRF, our model can be trained directly from images with no explicit 3D supervision. We conduct extensive experiments on ShapeNet benchmarks for single image novel view synthesis tasks with held-out objects as well as entire unseen categories. We further demonstrate the flexibility of pixelNeRF by demonstrating it on multi-object ShapeNet scenes and real scenes from the DTU dataset. In all cases, pixelNeRF outperforms current state-of-the-art baselines for novel view synthesis and single image 3D reconstruction.

The function models 3D scenes as a general radiance field, which takes a set of posed 2D images with camera poses and intrinsics as input, constructs an internal representation for each 3D point of the scene, and renders the corresponding appearance and geometry of any 3D point viewing from an arbitrary angle. The key to our approach is to explicitly integrate the principle of multi-view geometry to obtain the internal representations from observed 2D views, such that the learned implicit representations empirically remain multi-view consistent. In addition, we introduce an effective neural module to learn general features for each pixel in 2D images, allowing the constructed internal 3D representations to be general as well. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach.","publicationTitle":"arXiv:2010.04595 [cs]","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2020-11-29","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"GRF","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.04595","accessDate":"2021-06-07T09:23:49Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"arXiv.org","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"arXiv: 2010.04595","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{"dc:replaces":"http://zotero.org/users/7902311/items/Q8H2Z875"},"dateAdded":"2021-06-07T09:23:49Z","dateModified":"2021-06-20T16:24:58Z"}},{"key":"JW2UB4TN","version":56,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/JW2UB4TN","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/JW2UB4TN","type":"text/html"},"up":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/KSTKXVLX","type":"application/json"}},"meta":{"numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"JW2UB4TN","version":56,"parentItem":"KSTKXVLX","itemType":"note","note":"Comment: Code and data are available at: https://github.com/alextrevithick/GRF","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-06-20T16:03:47Z","dateModified":"2021-06-20T16:24:58Z"}},{"key":"ZN4Q97I6","version":94,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/ZN4Q97I6","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/ZN4Q97I6","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"creatorSummary":"Sohl-Dickstein et al.","parsedDate":"2015-11-18","numChildren":1},"data":{"key":"ZN4Q97I6","version":94,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Deep Unsupervised Learning using Nonequilibrium Thermodynamics","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Jascha","lastName":"Sohl-Dickstein"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Eric A.","lastName":"Weiss"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Niru","lastName":"Maheswaranathan"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Surya","lastName":"Ganguli"}],"abstractNote":"A central problem in machine learning involves modeling complex data-sets using highly ﬂexible families of probability distributions in which learning, sampling, inference, and evaluation are still analytically or computationally tractable. Here, we develop an approach that simultaneously achieves both ﬂexibility and tractability. The essential idea, inspired by non-equilibrium statistical physics, is to systematically and slowly destroy structure in a data distribution through an iterative forward diffusion process. We then learn a reverse diffusion process that restores structure in data, yielding a highly ﬂexible and tractable generative model of the data. This approach allows us to rapidly learn, sample from, and evaluate probabilities in deep generative models with thousands of layers or time steps, as well as to compute conditional and posterior probabilities under the learned model. We additionally release an open source reference implementation of the algorithm.","publicationTitle":"arXiv:1503.03585 [cond-mat, q-bio, stat]","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2015-11-18","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"en","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03585","accessDate":"2021-06-20T14:32:45Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"arXiv.org","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"arXiv: 1503.03585","tags":[],"collections":["TNWL7M5C"],"relations":{"dc:replaces":"http://zotero.org/users/7902311/items/UBPKFFDI"},"dateAdded":"2021-06-20T14:32:45Z","dateModified":"2021-06-20T16:24:57Z"}},{"key":"4Y6N7I5E","version":64,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/4Y6N7I5E","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/4Y6N7I5E","type":"text/html"},"up":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/865FJ5C2","type":"application/json"}},"meta":{"numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"4Y6N7I5E","version":64,"parentItem":"865FJ5C2","itemType":"attachment","linkMode":"imported_url","title":"arXiv.org Snapshot","accessDate":"2021-06-20T16:24:29Z","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09661","note":"","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"2006.html","md5":"0a1598ce31d9dbf71abd928b94988c1c","mtime":1624206269000,"tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-06-20T16:24:29Z","dateModified":"2021-06-20T16:24:29Z"}},{"key":"T5R4WXKK","version":64,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/T5R4WXKK","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/T5R4WXKK","type":"text/html"},"up":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/865FJ5C2","type":"application/json"}},"meta":{"numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"T5R4WXKK","version":64,"parentItem":"865FJ5C2","itemType":"attachment","linkMode":"imported_url","title":"arXiv Fulltext PDF","accessDate":"2021-06-20T16:24:18Z","url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.09661.pdf","note":"","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"Sitzmann et al. - 2020 - Implicit Neural Representations with Periodic Acti.pdf","md5":"2f23581f133c3af23338a4fcae7c7691","mtime":1624206258000,"tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-06-20T16:24:18Z","dateModified":"2021-06-20T16:24:18Z"}},{"key":"K2X9V4A7","version":62,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/K2X9V4A7","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/K2X9V4A7","type":"text/html"},"up":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/S8D7ZN3X","type":"application/json"}},"meta":{"numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"K2X9V4A7","version":62,"parentItem":"S8D7ZN3X","itemType":"note","note":"<p>Comment: 10 pages, 8 figures</p>","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-06-20T16:22:50Z","dateModified":"2021-06-20T16:22:58Z"}},{"key":"S8D7ZN3X","version":96,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/S8D7ZN3X","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/S8D7ZN3X","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"creatorSummary":"Sasaki et al.","parsedDate":"2021-04-12","numChildren":3},"data":{"key":"S8D7ZN3X","version":96,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"UNIT-DDPM: UNpaired Image Translation with Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Hiroshi","lastName":"Sasaki"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Chris G.","lastName":"Willcocks"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Toby P.","lastName":"Breckon"}],"abstractNote":"We propose a novel unpaired image-to-image translation method that uses denoising diffusion probabilistic models without requiring adversarial training.

However, NeRF's computational requirements are prohibitive for real-time applications: rendering views from a trained NeRF requires querying a multilayer perceptron (MLP) hundreds of times per ray. We present a method to train a NeRF, then precompute and store (i.e. \"bake\") it as a novel representation called a Sparse Neural Radiance Grid (SNeRG) that enables real-time rendering on commodity hardware. To achieve this, we introduce 1) a reformulation of NeRF's architecture, and 2) a sparse voxel grid representation with learned feature vectors. The resulting scene representation retains NeRF's ability to render fine geometric details and view-dependent appearance, is compact (averaging less than 90 MB per scene), and can be rendered in real-time (higher than 30 frames per second on a laptop GPU). Actual screen captures are shown in our video.","publicationTitle":"arXiv:2103.14645 [cs]","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2021-03-26","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.14645","accessDate":"2021-06-20T16:04:03Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"arXiv.org","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"arXiv: 2103.14645","tags":[],"collections":["8CLBFGR2","CPYKW3PF"],"relations":{"owl:sameAs":"http://zotero.org/groups/4320173/items/8YL49DGT"},"dateAdded":"2021-06-20T16:04:03Z","dateModified":"2021-06-20T16:04:03Z"}},{"key":"MCKXIXQG","version":198,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/MCKXIXQG","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/MCKXIXQG","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"creatorSummary":"DeVries et al.","parsedDate":"2021-04-01","numChildren":2},"data":{"key":"MCKXIXQG","version":198,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Unconstrained Scene Generation with Locally Conditioned Radiance Fields","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Terrance","lastName":"DeVries"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Miguel Angel","lastName":"Bautista"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Nitish","lastName":"Srivastava"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Graham W.","lastName":"Taylor"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Joshua M.","lastName":"Susskind"}],"abstractNote":"We tackle the challenge of learning a distribution over complex, realistic, indoor scenes. In this paper, we introduce Generative Scene Networks (GSN), which learns to decompose scenes into a collection of many local radiance fields that can be rendered from a free moving camera. Our model can be used as a prior to generate new scenes, or to complete a scene given only sparse 2D observations. Recent work has shown that generative models of radiance fields can capture properties such as multi-view consistency and view-dependent lighting. However, these models are specialized for constrained viewing of single objects, such as cars or faces. Due to the size and complexity of realistic indoor environments, existing models lack the representational capacity to adequately capture them. Our decomposition scheme scales to larger and more complex scenes while preserving details and diversity, and the learned prior enables high-quality rendering from viewpoints that are significantly different from observed viewpoints. When compared to existing models, GSN produces quantitatively higher-quality scene renderings across several different scene datasets.","publicationTitle":"arXiv:2104.00670 [cs]","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2021-04-01","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.00670","accessDate":"2021-06-20T16:04:03Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"arXiv.org","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"arXiv: 2104.00670","tags":[],"collections":["CPYKW3PF"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-06-20T16:04:03Z","dateModified":"2021-06-20T16:04:03Z"}},{"key":"EDN42UE6","version":96,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/EDN42UE6","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/EDN42UE6","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"creatorSummary":"Chen et al.","parsedDate":"2021-03-29","numChildren":2},"data":{"key":"EDN42UE6","version":96,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"MVSNeRF: Fast Generalizable Radiance Field Reconstruction from Multi-View Stereo","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Anpei","lastName":"Chen"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Zexiang","lastName":"Xu"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Fuqiang","lastName":"Zhao"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Xiaoshuai","lastName":"Zhang"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Fanbo","lastName":"Xiang"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Jingyi","lastName":"Yu"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Hao","lastName":"Su"}],"abstractNote":"We present MVSNeRF, a novel neural rendering approach that can efficiently reconstruct neural radiance fields for view synthesis.

Our approach leverages plane-swept cost volumes (widely used in multi-view stereo) for geometry-aware scene reasoning, and combines this with physically based volume rendering for neural radiance field reconstruction. We train our network on real objects in the DTU dataset, and test it on three different datasets to evaluate its effectiveness and generalizability. Our approach can generalize across scenes (even indoor scenes, completely different from our training scenes of objects) and generate realistic view synthesis results using only three input images, significantly outperforming concurrent works on generalizable radiance field reconstruction. Moreover, if dense images are captured, our estimated radiance field representation can be easily fine-tuned; this leads to fast per-scene reconstruction with higher rendering quality and substantially less optimization time than NeRF.","publicationTitle":"arXiv:2103.15595 [cs]","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2021-03-29","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"MVSNeRF","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.15595","accessDate":"2021-06-20T16:04:03Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"arXiv.org","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"arXiv: 2103.15595","tags":[],"collections":["CPYKW3PF"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-06-20T16:04:03Z","dateModified":"2021-06-20T16:04:03Z"}},{"key":"BKNP8W5V","version":82,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/BKNP8W5V","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/BKNP8W5V","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"creatorSummary":"Sucar et al.","parsedDate":"2021-03-23","numChildren":2},"data":{"key":"BKNP8W5V","version":82,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"iMAP: Implicit Mapping and Positioning in Real-Time","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Edgar","lastName":"Sucar"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Shikun","lastName":"Liu"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Joseph","lastName":"Ortiz"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Andrew J.","lastName":"Davison"}],"abstractNote":"We show for the first time that a multilayer perceptron (MLP) can serve as the only scene representation in a real-time SLAM system for a handheld RGB-D camera.

The advantages of an implicit MLP over standard dense SLAM techniques include efficient geometry representation with automatic detail control and smooth, plausible filling-in of unobserved regions such as the back surfaces of objects.","publicationTitle":"arXiv:2103.12352 [cs]","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2021-03-23","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"iMAP","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.12352","accessDate":"2021-06-20T16:04:01Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"arXiv.org","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"arXiv: 2103.12352","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-06-20T16:04:02Z","dateModified":"2021-06-20T16:04:02Z"}},{"key":"YABERY8I","version":360,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/YABERY8I","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/YABERY8I","type":"text/html"},"up":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/J9YJJ2H5","type":"application/json"}},"meta":{"numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"YABERY8I","version":360,"parentItem":"J9YJJ2H5","itemType":"note","note":"Comment: main paper: 10 pages, 6 figures; supplementary: 10 pages, 17 figures","tags":[],"relations":{"owl:sameAs":"http://zotero.org/groups/4320173/items/X6U3WULV"},"dateAdded":"2021-06-20T16:04:01Z","dateModified":"2021-06-20T16:04:01Z"}},{"key":"J9YJJ2H5","version":360,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/J9YJJ2H5","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/J9YJJ2H5","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"creatorSummary":"Garbin et al.","parsedDate":"2021-04-15","numChildren":3},"data":{"key":"J9YJJ2H5","version":360,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"FastNeRF: High-Fidelity Neural Rendering at 200FPS","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Stephan J.","lastName":"Garbin"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Marek","lastName":"Kowalski"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Matthew","lastName":"Johnson"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Jamie","lastName":"Shotton"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Julien","lastName":"Valentin"}],"abstractNote":"Recent work on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) showed how neural networks can be used to encode complex 3D environments that can be rendered photorealistically from novel viewpoints.

Motivated by scenarios on mobile and mixed reality devices, we propose FastNeRF, the first NeRF-based system capable of rendering high fidelity photorealistic images at 200Hz on a high-end consumer GPU. The core of our method is a graphics-inspired factorization that allows for (i) compactly caching a deep radiance map at each position in space, (ii) efficiently querying that map using ray directions to estimate the pixel values in the rendered image.

However, one major limitation preventing the use of NeRF in interactive and real-time rendering applications is the prohibitive computational cost of excessive network evaluations along each view ray, requiring dozens of petaFLOPS when aiming for real-time rendering on consumer hardware. In this work, we take a step towards bringing neural representations closer to practical rendering of synthetic content in interactive and real-time applications, such as games and virtual reality. We show that the number of samples required for each view ray can be significantly reduced when local samples are placed around surfaces in the scene. To this end, we propose a depth oracle network, which predicts ray sample locations for each view ray with a single network evaluation. We show that using a classification network around logarithmically discretized and spherically warped depth values is essential to encode surface locations rather than directly estimating depth. The combination of these techniques leads to DONeRF, a dual network design with a depth oracle network as a first step and a locally sampled shading network for ray accumulation. With our design, we reduce the inference costs by up to 48x compared to NeRF. Using an off-the-shelf inference API in combination with simple compute kernels, we are the first to render raymarching-based neural representations at interactive frame rates (15 frames per second at 800x800) on a single GPU. At the same time, since we focus on the important parts of the scene around surfaces, we achieve equal or better quality compared to NeRF to enable interactive high-quality rendering.","publicationTitle":"arXiv:2103.03231 [cs]","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2021-05-11","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"DONeRF","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.03231","accessDate":"2021-06-20T16:04:01Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"arXiv.org","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"arXiv: 2103.03231","tags":[],"collections":["8CLBFGR2","CPYKW3PF"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-06-20T16:04:01Z","dateModified":"2021-06-20T16:04:01Z"}},{"key":"SHWZ65JX","version":62,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/SHWZ65JX","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/SHWZ65JX","type":"text/html"},"up":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/Q3DXFQ7X","type":"application/json"}},"meta":{"numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"SHWZ65JX","version":62,"parentItem":"Q3DXFQ7X","itemType":"note","note":"Comment: Project website: https://depthoraclenerf.github.io/","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-06-20T16:04:01Z","dateModified":"2021-06-20T16:04:01Z"}},{"key":"PDM4ZUQK","version":358,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/PDM4ZUQK","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/PDM4ZUQK","type":"text/html"},"up":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/DK93ZEF2","type":"application/json"}},"meta":{"numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"PDM4ZUQK","version":358,"parentItem":"DK93ZEF2","itemType":"note","note":"Comment: CVPR 2021 (Oral)","tags":[],"relations":{"owl:sameAs":"http://zotero.org/groups/4320173/items/CVDUFNNZ"},"dateAdded":"2021-06-20T16:04:00Z","dateModified":"2021-06-20T16:04:00Z"}},{"key":"QNXL2EIJ","version":82,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/QNXL2EIJ","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/QNXL2EIJ","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"creatorSummary":"Lombardi et al.","parsedDate":"2021-05-06","numChildren":3},"data":{"key":"QNXL2EIJ","version":82,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Mixture of Volumetric Primitives for Efficient Neural Rendering","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Stephen","lastName":"Lombardi"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Tomas","lastName":"Simon"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Gabriel","lastName":"Schwartz"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Zollhoefer"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Yaser","lastName":"Sheikh"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Jason","lastName":"Saragih"}],"abstractNote":"Real-time rendering and animation of humans is a core function in games, movies, and telepresence applications. Existing methods have a number of drawbacks we aim to address with our work. Triangle meshes have difficulty modeling thin structures like hair, volumetric representations like Neural Volumes are too low-resolution given a reasonable memory budget, and high-resolution implicit representations like Neural Radiance Fields are too slow for use in real-time applications. We present Mixture of Volumetric Primitives (MVP), a representation for rendering dynamic 3D content that combines the completeness of volumetric representations with the efficiency of primitive-based rendering, e.g., point-based or mesh-based methods. Our approach achieves this by leveraging spatially shared computation with a deconvolutional architecture and by minimizing computation in empty regions of space with volumetric primitives that can move to cover only occupied regions. Our parameterization supports the integration of correspondence and tracking constraints, while being robust to areas where classical tracking fails, such as around thin or translucent structures and areas with large topological variability. MVP is a hybrid that generalizes both volumetric and primitive-based representations. Through a series of extensive experiments we demonstrate that it inherits the strengths of each, while avoiding many of their limitations. We also compare our approach to several state-of-the-art methods and demonstrate that MVP produces superior results in terms of quality and runtime performance.","publicationTitle":"arXiv:2103.01954 [cs]","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2021-05-06","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.01954","accessDate":"2021-06-20T16:04:00Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"arXiv.org","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"arXiv: 2103.01954","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-06-20T16:04:00Z","dateModified":"2021-06-20T16:04:00Z"}},{"key":"N9TACYGJ","version":82,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/N9TACYGJ","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/N9TACYGJ","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"creatorSummary":"Xiang et al.","parsedDate":"2021-03-01","numChildren":2},"data":{"key":"N9TACYGJ","version":82,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"NeuTex: Neural Texture Mapping for Volumetric Neural Rendering","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Fanbo","lastName":"Xiang"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Zexiang","lastName":"Xu"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Miloš","lastName":"Hašan"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Yannick","lastName":"Hold-Geoffroy"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Kalyan","lastName":"Sunkavalli"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Hao","lastName":"Su"}],"abstractNote":"Recent work has demonstrated that volumetric scene representations combined with differentiable volume rendering can enable photo-realistic rendering for challenging scenes that mesh reconstruction fails on.

Instead, we present an approach that explicitly disentangles geometry--represented as a continuous 3D volume--from appearance--represented as a continuous 2D texture map. We achieve this by introducing a 3D-to-2D texture mapping (or surface parameterization) network into volumetric representations. We constrain this texture mapping network using an additional 2D-to-3D inverse mapping network and a novel cycle consistency loss to make 3D surface points map to 2D texture points that map back to the original 3D points. We demonstrate that this representation can be reconstructed using only multi-view image supervision and generates high-quality rendering results. More importantly, by separating geometry and texture, we allow users to edit appearance by simply editing 2D texture maps.","publicationTitle":"arXiv:2103.00762 [cs]","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2021-03-01","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"NeuTex","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00762","accessDate":"2021-06-20T16:04:00Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"arXiv.org","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"arXiv: 2103.00762","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-06-20T16:04:00Z","dateModified":"2021-06-20T16:04:00Z"}},{"key":"BE56GYH3","version":82,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/BE56GYH3","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/BE56GYH3","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"creatorSummary":"Wang et al.","parsedDate":"2021-04-06","numChildren":3},"data":{"key":"BE56GYH3","version":82,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"IBRNet: Learning Multi-View Image-Based Rendering","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Qianqian","lastName":"Wang"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Zhicheng","lastName":"Wang"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Kyle","lastName":"Genova"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Pratul","lastName":"Srinivasan"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Howard","lastName":"Zhou"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Jonathan T.","lastName":"Barron"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Ricardo","lastName":"Martin-Brualla"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Noah","lastName":"Snavely"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Funkhouser"}],"abstractNote":"We present a method that synthesizes novel views of complex scenes by interpolating a sparse set of nearby views.

State-of-the-art methods typically encode the SDF with a large, fixed-size neural network to approximate complex shapes with implicit surfaces. Rendering with these large networks is, however, computationally expensive since it requires many forward passes through the network for every pixel, making these representations impractical for real-time graphics. We introduce an efficient neural representation that, for the first time, enables real-time rendering of high-fidelity neural SDFs, while achieving state-of-the-art geometry reconstruction quality. We represent implicit surfaces using an octree-based feature volume which adaptively fits shapes with multiple discrete levels of detail (LODs), and enables continuous LOD with SDF interpolation. We further develop an efficient algorithm to directly render our novel neural SDF representation in real-time by querying only the necessary LODs with sparse octree traversal. We show that our representation is 2-3 orders of magnitude more efficient in terms of rendering speed compared to previous works. Furthermore, it produces state-of-the-art reconstruction quality for complex shapes under both 3D geometric and 2D image-space metrics.","publicationTitle":"arXiv:2101.10994 [cs]","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2021-01-26","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"Neural Geometric Level of Detail","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.10994","accessDate":"2021-06-20T16:03:58Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"arXiv.org","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"arXiv: 2101.10994","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-06-20T16:03:59Z","dateModified":"2021-06-20T16:03:59Z"}},{"key":"UQPB3TH8","version":81,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/UQPB3TH8","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/UQPB3TH8","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"creatorSummary":"Rematas et al.","parsedDate":"2021-02-17","numChildren":3},"data":{"key":"UQPB3TH8","version":81,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"ShaRF: Shape-conditioned Radiance Fields from a Single View","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Konstantinos","lastName":"Rematas"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Ricardo","lastName":"Martin-Brualla"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Vittorio","lastName":"Ferrari"}],"abstractNote":"We present a method for estimating neural scenes representations of objects given only a single image. The core of our method is the estimation of a geometric scaffold for the object and its use as a guide for the reconstruction of the underlying radiance field.

During inference, we optimize both the latent codes and the networks to fit a test image of a new object. The explicit disentanglement of shape and appearance allows our model to be fine-tuned given a single image. We can then render new views in a geometrically consistent manner and they represent faithfully the input object. Additionally, our method is able to generalize to images outside of the training domain (more realistic renderings and even real photographs).

Our approach takes RGB images of a dynamic scene as input, e.g., from a monocular video recording, and creates a high-quality space-time geometry and appearance representation. In particular, we show that even a single handheld consumer-grade camera is sufficient to synthesize sophisticated renderings of a dynamic scene from novel virtual camera views, for example a `bullet-time' video effect. Our method disentangles the dynamic scene into a canonical volume and its deformation. Scene deformation is implemented as ray bending, where straight rays are deformed non-rigidly to represent scene motion. We also propose a novel rigidity regression network that enables us to better constrain rigid regions of the scene, which leads to more stable results. The ray bending and rigidity network are trained without any explicit supervision. In addition to novel view synthesis, our formulation enables dense correspondence estimation across views and time, as well as compelling video editing applications such as motion exaggeration. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method using extensive evaluations, including ablation studies and comparisons to the state of the art. We urge the reader to watch the supplemental video for qualitative results. Our code will be open sourced.","publicationTitle":"arXiv:2012.12247 [cs]","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2021-02-26","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"Non-Rigid Neural Radiance Fields","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.12247","accessDate":"2021-06-20T16:03:58Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"arXiv.org","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"arXiv: 2012.12247","tags":[],"collections":["CPYKW3PF","I7H95BKE"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-06-20T16:03:58Z","dateModified":"2021-06-20T16:03:58Z"}},{"key":"IWDM4ZF5","version":95,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/IWDM4ZF5","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/IWDM4ZF5","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"creatorSummary":"Wang et al.","parsedDate":"2020-12-17","numChildren":2},"data":{"key":"IWDM4ZF5","version":95,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Learning Compositional Radiance Fields of Dynamic Human Heads","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Ziyan","lastName":"Wang"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Timur","lastName":"Bagautdinov"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Stephen","lastName":"Lombardi"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Tomas","lastName":"Simon"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Jason","lastName":"Saragih"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Jessica","lastName":"Hodgins"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Zollhöfer"}],"abstractNote":"Photorealistic rendering of dynamic humans is an important ability for telepresence systems, virtual shopping, synthetic data generation, and more. Recently, neural rendering methods, which combine techniques from computer graphics and machine learning, have created high-fidelity models of humans and objects. Some of these methods do not produce results with high-enough fidelity for driveable human models (Neural Volumes) whereas others have extremely long rendering times (NeRF). We propose a novel compositional 3D representation that combines the best of previous methods to produce both higher-resolution and faster results. Our representation bridges the gap between discrete and continuous volumetric representations by combining a coarse 3D-structure-aware grid of animation codes with a continuous learned scene function that maps every position and its corresponding local animation code to its view-dependent emitted radiance and local volume density. Differentiable volume rendering is employed to compute photo-realistic novel views of the human head and upper body as well as to train our novel representation end-to-end using only 2D supervision. In addition, we show that the learned dynamic radiance field can be used to synthesize novel unseen expressions based on a global animation code. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results for synthesizing novel views of dynamic human heads and the upper body.","publicationTitle":"arXiv:2012.09955 [cs]","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2020-12-17","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.09955","accessDate":"2021-06-20T16:03:58Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"arXiv.org","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"arXiv: 2012.09955","tags":[],"collections":["CPYKW3PF"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-06-20T16:03:58Z","dateModified":"2021-06-20T16:03:58Z"}},{"key":"75JSFXK4","version":81,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/75JSFXK4","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/75JSFXK4","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"creatorSummary":"Peng et al.","parsedDate":"2021-03-29","numChildren":3},"data":{"key":"75JSFXK4","version":81,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Neural Body: Implicit Neural Representations with Structured Latent Codes for Novel View Synthesis of Dynamic Humans","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Sida","lastName":"Peng"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Yuanqing","lastName":"Zhang"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Yinghao","lastName":"Xu"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Qianqian","lastName":"Wang"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Qing","lastName":"Shuai"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Hujun","lastName":"Bao"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Xiaowei","lastName":"Zhou"}],"abstractNote":"This paper addresses the challenge of novel view synthesis for a human performer from a very sparse set of camera views. Some recent works have shown that learning implicit neural representations of 3D scenes achieves remarkable view synthesis quality given dense input views. However, the representation learning will be ill-posed if the views are highly sparse. To solve this ill-posed problem, our key idea is to integrate observations over video frames. To this end, we propose Neural Body, a new human body representation which assumes that the learned neural representations at different frames share the same set of latent codes anchored to a deformable mesh, so that the observations across frames can be naturally integrated. The deformable mesh also provides geometric guidance for the network to learn 3D representations more efficiently. To evaluate our approach, we create a multi-view dataset named ZJU-MoCap that captures performers with complex motions. Experiments on ZJU-MoCap show that our approach outperforms prior works by a large margin in terms of novel view synthesis quality. We also demonstrate the capability of our approach to reconstruct a moving person from a monocular video on the People-Snapshot dataset.

The main insight is that simply shrink-wrapping a planar mesh sheet onto the input image, consistent with the learned intermediate depth, captures underlying geometry sufficient to generate photorealistic unseen views with large viewpoint changes. To operationalize this, we propose a novel differentiable texture sampler that allows our wrapped mesh sheet to be textured and rendered differentiably into an image from a target viewpoint. Our approach is category-agnostic, end-to-end trainable without using any 3D supervision, and requires a single image at test time. We also explore a simple extension by stacking multiple layers of Worldsheets to better handle occlusions. Worldsheet consistently outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods on single-image view synthesis across several datasets. Furthermore, this simple idea captures novel views surprisingly well on a wide range of high-resolution in-the-wild images, converting them into navigable 3D pop-ups.

This is a challenging problem that goes far beyond the capabilities of current view synthesis methods, which work for a limited range of viewpoints and quickly degenerate when presented with a large camera motion. Methods designed for video generation also have limited ability to produce long video sequences and are often agnostic to scene geometry. We take a hybrid approach that integrates both geometry and image synthesis in an iterative render, refine, and repeat framework, allowing for long-range generation that cover large distances after hundreds of frames. Our approach can be trained from a set of monocular video sequences without any manual annotation. We propose a dataset of aerial footage of natural coastal scenes, and compare our method with recent view synthesis and conditional video generation baselines, showing that it can generate plausible scenes for much longer time horizons over large camera trajectories compared to existing methods.

While NeRFs synthesize realistic pictures, they only model static scenes and are closely tied to specific imaging conditions. This property makes NeRFs hard to generalize to new scenarios, including new lighting or new arrangements of objects. Instead of learning a scene radiance field as a NeRF does, we propose to learn object-centric neural scattering functions (OSFs), a representation that models per-object light transport implicitly using a lighting- and view-dependent neural network. This enables rendering scenes even when objects or lights move, without retraining. Combined with a volumetric path tracing procedure, our framework is capable of rendering both intra- and inter-object light transport effects including occlusions, specularities, shadows, and indirect illumination.

Digitally modeling and reconstructing a talking human is a key building-block for a variety of applications. Especially, for telepresence applications in AR or VR, a faithful reproduction of the appearance including novel viewpoints or head-poses is required. In contrast to state-of-the-art approaches that model the geometry and material properties explicitly, or are purely image-based, we introduce an implicit representation of the head based on scene representation networks. To handle the dynamics of the face, we combine our scene representation network with a low-dimensional morphable model which provides explicit control over pose and expressions. We use volumetric rendering to generate images from this hybrid representation and demonstrate that such a dynamic neural scene representation can be learned from monocular input data only, without the need of a specialized capture setup. In our experiments, we show that this learned volumetric representation allows for photo-realistic image generation that surpasses the quality of state-of-the-art video-based reenactment methods.","publicationTitle":"arXiv:2012.03065 [cs]","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2020-12-05","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.03065","accessDate":"2021-06-20T16:03:56Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"arXiv.org","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"arXiv: 2012.03065","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-06-20T16:03:56Z","dateModified":"2021-06-20T16:03:56Z"}},{"key":"KWK58QX5","version":61,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/KWK58QX5","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/KWK58QX5","type":"text/html"},"up":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/HTAUNQ6X","type":"application/json"}},"meta":{"numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"KWK58QX5","version":61,"parentItem":"HTAUNQ6X","itemType":"note","note":"Comment: Summary Video: https://youtu.be/NtR7xgxSL1U Project Webpage: https://shellguo.com/osf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-06-20T16:03:56Z","dateModified":"2021-06-20T16:03:56Z"}},{"key":"Y7TB4Y7M","version":60,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/Y7TB4Y7M","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/Y7TB4Y7M","type":"text/html"},"up":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/ZT43H7LK","type":"application/json"}},"meta":{"numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"Y7TB4Y7M","version":60,"parentItem":"ZT43H7LK","itemType":"note","note":"Comment: Video: https://youtu.be/m7oROLdQnjk | Project page: https://gafniguy.github.io/4D-Facial-Avatars/","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-06-20T16:03:56Z","dateModified":"2021-06-20T16:03:56Z"}},{"key":"U6R8PFHN","version":60,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/U6R8PFHN","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/U6R8PFHN","type":"text/html"},"up":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/6L8GNRIL","type":"application/json"}},"meta":{"numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"U6R8PFHN","version":60,"parentItem":"6L8GNRIL","itemType":"note","note":"Comment: Project webpage: https://portrait-nerf.github.io/","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-06-20T16:03:56Z","dateModified":"2021-06-20T16:03:56Z"}},{"key":"4BWLNEMH","version":95,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/4BWLNEMH","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/4BWLNEMH","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"creatorSummary":"Yen-Chen et al.","parsedDate":"2021-04-01","numChildren":3},"data":{"key":"4BWLNEMH","version":95,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"iNeRF: Inverting Neural Radiance Fields for Pose Estimation","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Lin","lastName":"Yen-Chen"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Pete","lastName":"Florence"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Jonathan T.","lastName":"Barron"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Alberto","lastName":"Rodriguez"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Phillip","lastName":"Isola"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Tsung-Yi","lastName":"Lin"}],"abstractNote":"We present iNeRF, a framework that performs mesh-free pose estimation by \"inverting\" a Neural RadianceField (NeRF).

In this work, we investigate whether we can apply analysis-by-synthesis via NeRF for mesh-free, RGB-only 6DoF pose estimation - given an image, find the translation and rotation of a camera relative to a 3D object or scene. Our method assumes that no object mesh models are available during either training or test time. Starting from an initial pose estimate, we use gradient descent to minimize the residual between pixels rendered from a NeRF and pixels in an observed image. In our experiments, we first study 1) how to sample rays during pose refinement for iNeRF to collect informative gradients and 2) how different batch sizes of rays affect iNeRF on a synthetic dataset. We then show that for complex real-world scenes from the LLFF dataset, iNeRF can improve NeRF by estimating the camera poses of novel images and using these images as additional training data for NeRF. Finally, we show iNeRF can perform category-level object pose estimation, including object instances not seen during training, with RGB images by inverting a NeRF model inferred from a single view.","publicationTitle":"arXiv:2012.05877 [cs]","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2021-04-01","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"iNeRF","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.05877","accessDate":"2021-06-20T16:03:55Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"arXiv.org","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"arXiv: 2012.05877","tags":[],"collections":["CPYKW3PF"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-06-20T16:03:55Z","dateModified":"2021-06-20T16:03:55Z"}},{"key":"VMJXU2HQ","version":80,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/VMJXU2HQ","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/VMJXU2HQ","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"creatorSummary":"Srinivasan et al.","parsedDate":"2020-12-07","numChildren":3},"data":{"key":"VMJXU2HQ","version":80,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"NeRV: Neural Reflectance and Visibility Fields for Relighting and View Synthesis","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Pratul P.","lastName":"Srinivasan"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Boyang","lastName":"Deng"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Xiuming","lastName":"Zhang"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Matthew","lastName":"Tancik"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Ben","lastName":"Mildenhall"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Jonathan T.","lastName":"Barron"}],"abstractNote":"We present a method that takes as input a set of images of a scene illuminated by unconstrained known lighting, and produces as output a 3D representation that can be rendered from novel viewpoints under arbitrary lighting conditions.

Together, these allow us to render novel views of the object under arbitrary lighting, including indirect illumination effects. The predicted visibility and surface intersection fields are critical to our model's ability to simulate direct and indirect illumination during training, because the brute-force techniques used by prior work are intractable for lighting conditions outside of controlled setups with a single light.

Such positional encoding is indispensable for generating images with high fidelity. The same phenomenon is observed in other generative architectures such as DCGAN and PGGAN. We further show that zero padding leads to an unbalanced spatial bias with a vague relation between locations.

This problem is inherently more challenging when the illumination is not a single light source under laboratory conditions but is instead an unconstrained environmental illumination. Though recent work has shown that implicit representations can be used to model the radiance field of an object, these techniques only enable view synthesis and not relighting. Additionally, evaluating these radiance fields is resource and time-intensive. By decomposing a scene into explicit representations, any rendering framework can be leveraged to generate novel views under any illumination in real-time. NeRD is a method that achieves this decomposition by introducing physically-based rendering to neural radiance fields. Even challenging non-Lambertian reflectances, complex geometry, and unknown illumination can be decomposed into high-quality models.

Among these applications, neural volume rendering has recently been proposed as a new paradigm for view synthesis, achieving photorealistic image quality. However, a fundamental obstacle to making these methods practical is the extreme computational and memory requirements caused by the required volume integrations along the rendered rays during training and inference. Millions of rays, each requiring hundreds of forward passes through a neural network are needed to approximate those integrations with Monte Carlo sampling. Here, we propose automatic integration, a new framework for learning efficient, closed-form solutions to integrals using coordinate-based neural networks. For training, we instantiate the computational graph corresponding to the derivative of the network. The graph is fitted to the signal to integrate. After optimization, we reassemble the graph to obtain a network that represents the antiderivative. By the fundamental theorem of calculus, this enables the calculation of any definite integral in two evaluations of the network. Applying this approach to neural rendering, we improve a tradeoff between rendering speed and image quality: improving render times by greater than 10 times with a tradeoff of slightly reduced image quality.","publicationTitle":"arXiv:2012.01714 [cs]","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2021-05-22","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"AutoInt","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.01714","accessDate":"2021-06-20T16:03:53Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"arXiv.org","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"arXiv: 2012.01714","tags":[],"collections":["CPYKW3PF"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-06-20T16:03:53Z","dateModified":"2021-06-20T16:03:53Z"}},{"key":"43G9UVNV","version":121,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/43G9UVNV","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/43G9UVNV","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"creatorSummary":"Tancik et al.","parsedDate":"2021-03-23","numChildren":3},"data":{"key":"43G9UVNV","version":121,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Learned Initializations for Optimizing Coordinate-Based Neural Representations","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Matthew","lastName":"Tancik"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Ben","lastName":"Mildenhall"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Terrance","lastName":"Wang"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Divi","lastName":"Schmidt"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Pratul P.","lastName":"Srinivasan"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Jonathan T.","lastName":"Barron"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Ren","lastName":"Ng"}],"abstractNote":"Coordinate-based neural representations have shown significant promise as an alternative to discrete, array-based representations for complex low dimensional signals.

Among these, stands out the Neural radiance fields (NeRF), which trains a deep network to map 5D input coordinates (representing spatial location and viewing direction) into a volume density and view-dependent emitted radiance. However, despite achieving an unprecedented level of photorealism on the generated images, NeRF is only applicable to static scenes, where the same spatial location can be queried from different images. In this paper we introduce D-NeRF, a method that extends neural radiance fields to a dynamic domain, allowing to reconstruct and render novel images of objects under rigid and non-rigid motions from a \\emph{single} camera moving around the scene. For this purpose we consider time as an additional input to the system, and split the learning process in two main stages: one that encodes the scene into a canonical space and another that maps this canonical representation into the deformed scene at a particular time. Both mappings are simultaneously learned using fully-connected networks. Once the networks are trained, D-NeRF can render novel images, controlling both the camera view and the time variable, and thus, the object movement. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on scenes with objects under rigid, articulated and non-rigid motions. Code, model weights and the dynamic scenes dataset will be released.","publicationTitle":"arXiv:2011.13961 [cs]","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2020-11-27","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"D-NeRF","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.13961","accessDate":"2021-06-20T16:03:53Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"arXiv.org","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"arXiv: 2011.13961","tags":[],"collections":["CPYKW3PF"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-06-20T16:03:53Z","dateModified":"2021-06-20T16:03:53Z"}},{"key":"MDMF8SRF","version":60,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/MDMF8SRF","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/MDMF8SRF","type":"text/html"},"up":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/43G9UVNV","type":"application/json"}},"meta":{"numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"MDMF8SRF","version":60,"parentItem":"43G9UVNV","itemType":"note","note":"Comment: Project page: https://www.matthewtancik.com/learnit","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-06-20T16:03:53Z","dateModified":"2021-06-20T16:03:53Z"}},{"key":"DQHUP86T","version":80,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/DQHUP86T","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/DQHUP86T","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"creatorSummary":"Chan et al.","parsedDate":"2021-04-05","numChildren":3},"data":{"key":"DQHUP86T","version":80,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"pi-GAN: Periodic Implicit Generative Adversarial Networks for 3D-Aware Image Synthesis","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Eric R.","lastName":"Chan"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Monteiro"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Petr","lastName":"Kellnhofer"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Jiajun","lastName":"Wu"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Gordon","lastName":"Wetzstein"}],"abstractNote":"We have witnessed rapid progress on 3D-aware image synthesis, leveraging recent advances in generative visual models and neural rendering.

But for many applications, this is not enough: content creation also needs to be controllable. While several recent works investigate how to disentangle underlying factors of variation in the data, most of them operate in 2D and hence ignore that our world is three-dimensional. Further, only few works consider the compositional nature of scenes. Our key hypothesis is that incorporating a compositional 3D scene representation into the generative model leads to more controllable image synthesis. Representing scenes as compositional generative neural feature fields allows us to disentangle one or multiple objects from the background as well as individual objects' shapes and appearances while learning from unstructured and unposed image collections without any additional supervision. Combining this scene representation with a neural rendering pipeline yields a fast and realistic image synthesis model. As evidenced by our experiments, our model is able to disentangle individual objects and allows for translating and rotating them in the scene as well as changing the camera pose.","publicationTitle":"arXiv:2011.12100 [cs]","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2021-04-29","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"GIRAFFE","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.12100","accessDate":"2021-06-20T16:03:50Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"arXiv.org","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"arXiv: 2011.12100","tags":[{"tag":"nerf"}],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-06-20T16:03:50Z","dateModified":"2021-06-20T16:03:50Z"}},{"key":"ZNDAS9TD","version":94,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/ZNDAS9TD","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/ZNDAS9TD","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"creatorSummary":"Rebain et al.","parsedDate":"2020-11-24","numChildren":2},"data":{"key":"ZNDAS9TD","version":94,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"DeRF: Decomposed Radiance Fields","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Rebain"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Jiang"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Soroosh","lastName":"Yazdani"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Ke","lastName":"Li"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Kwang Moo","lastName":"Yi"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Andrea","lastName":"Tagliasacchi"}],"abstractNote":"With the advent of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), neural networks can now render novel views of a 3D scene with quality that fools the human eye.

In this paper, we propose a technique based on spatial decomposition capable of mitigating this issue. Our key observation is that there are diminishing returns in employing larger (deeper and/or wider) networks. Hence, we propose to spatially decompose a scene and dedicate smaller networks for each decomposed part. When working together, these networks can render the whole scene. This allows us near-constant inference time regardless of the number of decomposed parts. Moreover, we show that a Voronoi spatial decomposition is preferable for this purpose, as it is provably compatible with the Painter's Algorithm for efficient and GPU-friendly rendering. Our experiments show that for real-world scenes, our method provides up to 3x more efficient inference than NeRF (with the same rendering quality), or an improvement of up to 1.0~dB in PSNR (for the same inference cost).","publicationTitle":"arXiv:2011.12490 [cs]","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2020-11-24","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"DeRF","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.12490","accessDate":"2021-06-20T16:03:50Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"arXiv.org","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"arXiv: 2011.12490","tags":[],"collections":["CPYKW3PF"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-06-20T16:03:50Z","dateModified":"2021-06-20T16:03:50Z"}},{"key":"XCPDD5N9","version":79,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/XCPDD5N9","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/XCPDD5N9","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"creatorSummary":"Li et al.","parsedDate":"2020-11-22","numChildren":3},"data":{"key":"XCPDD5N9","version":79,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Multi-Plane Program Induction with 3D Box Priors","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Yikai","lastName":"Li"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Jiayuan","lastName":"Mao"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Xiuming","lastName":"Zhang"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"William T.","lastName":"Freeman"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Joshua B.","lastName":"Tenenbaum"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Noah","lastName":"Snavely"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Jiajun","lastName":"Wu"}],"abstractNote":"We consider two important aspects in understanding and editing images: modeling regular, program-like texture or patterns in 2D planes, and 3D posing of these planes in the scene.

Recent studies have demonstrated promising results by learning scene representations that implicitly encode both geometry and appearance without 3D supervision. However, existing approaches in practice often show blurry renderings caused by the limited network capacity or the difficulty in finding accurate intersections of camera rays with the scene geometry. Synthesizing high-resolution imagery from these representations often requires time-consuming optical ray marching. In this work, we introduce Neural Sparse Voxel Fields (NSVF), a new neural scene representation for fast and high-quality free-viewpoint rendering. NSVF defines a set of voxel-bounded implicit fields organized in a sparse voxel octree to model local properties in each cell. We progressively learn the underlying voxel structures with a differentiable ray-marching operation from only a set of posed RGB images. With the sparse voxel octree structure, rendering novel views can be accelerated by skipping the voxels containing no relevant scene content. Our method is typically over 10 times faster than the state-of-the-art (namely, NeRF(Mildenhall et al., 2020)) at inference time while achieving higher quality results. Furthermore, by utilizing an explicit sparse voxel representation, our method can easily be applied to scene editing and scene composition. We also demonstrate several challenging tasks, including multi-scene learning, free-viewpoint rendering of a moving human, and large-scale scene rendering.

Recent efforts have turned to learning 3D reconstruction without 3D supervision from RGB images with annotated 2D silhouettes, dramatically reducing the cost and effort of annotation. These techniques, however, remain impractical as they still require multi-view annotations of the same object instance during training. As a result, most experimental efforts to date have been limited to synthetic datasets. In this paper, we address this issue and propose SDF-SRN, an approach that requires only a single view of objects at training time, offering greater utility for real-world scenarios. SDF-SRN learns implicit 3D shape representations to handle arbitrary shape topologies that may exist in the datasets. To this end, we derive a novel differentiable rendering formulation for learning signed distance functions (SDF) from 2D silhouettes. Our method outperforms the state of the art under challenging single-view supervision settings on both synthetic and real-world datasets.","publicationTitle":"arXiv:2010.10505 [cs]","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2020-10-20","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"SDF-SRN","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.10505","accessDate":"2021-06-20T16:03:48Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"arXiv.org","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"arXiv: 2010.10505","tags":[],"collections":["5XFEXSAE"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-06-20T16:03:48Z","dateModified":"2021-06-20T16:03:48Z"}},{"key":"BVV9955T","version":167,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/BVV9955T","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/BVV9955T","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"creatorSummary":"Riegler and Koltun","parsedDate":"2021-05-02","numChildren":3},"data":{"key":"BVV9955T","version":167,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Stable View Synthesis","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Gernot","lastName":"Riegler"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Vladlen","lastName":"Koltun"}],"abstractNote":"We present Stable View Synthesis (SVS). Given a set of source images depicting a scene from freely distributed viewpoints, SVS synthesizes new views of the scene. The method operates on a geometric scaffold computed via structure-from-motion and multi-view stereo. Each point on this 3D scaffold is associated with view rays and corresponding feature vectors that encode the appearance of this point in the input images. The core of SVS is view-dependent on-surface feature aggregation, in which directional feature vectors at each 3D point are processed to produce a new feature vector for a ray that maps this point into the new target view. The target view is then rendered by a convolutional network from a tensor of features synthesized in this way for all pixels. The method is composed of differentiable modules and is trained end-to-end. It supports spatially-varying view-dependent importance weighting and feature transformation of source images at each point; spatial and temporal stability due to the smooth dependence of on-surface feature aggregation on the target view; and synthesis of view-dependent effects such as specular reflection. Experimental results demonstrate that SVS outperforms state-of-the-art view synthesis methods both quantitatively and qualitatively on three diverse real-world datasets, achieving unprecedented levels of realism in free-viewpoint video of challenging large-scale scenes.

Recent works represent 3D surfaces implicitly with a Neural Network, thereby breaking previous barriers in resolution, and ability to represent diverse topologies. However, neural implicit representations are limited to closed surfaces, which divide the space into inside and outside. Many real world objects such as walls of a scene scanned by a sensor, clothing, or a car with inner structures are not closed. This constitutes a significant barrier, in terms of data pre-processing (objects need to be artificially closed creating artifacts), and the ability to output open surfaces. In this work, we propose Neural Distance Fields (NDF), a neural network based model which predicts the unsigned distance field for arbitrary 3D shapes given sparse point clouds. NDF represent surfaces at high resolutions as prior implicit models, but do not require closed surface data, and significantly broaden the class of representable shapes in the output. NDF allow to extract the surface as very dense point clouds and as meshes. We also show that NDF allow for surface normal calculation and can be rendered using a slight modification of sphere tracing. We find NDF can be used for multi-target regression (multiple outputs for one input) with techniques that have been exclusively used for rendering in graphics. Experiments on ShapeNet show that NDF, while simple, is the state-of-the art, and allows to reconstruct shapes with inner structures, such as the chairs inside a bus. Notably, we show that NDF are not restricted to 3D shapes, and can approximate more general open surfaces such as curves, manifolds, and functions.

While NeRF works well on images of static subjects captured under controlled settings, it is incapable of modeling many ubiquitous, real-world phenomena in uncontrolled images, such as variable illumination or transient occluders. We introduce a series of extensions to NeRF to address these issues, thereby enabling accurate reconstructions from unstructured image collections taken from the internet. We apply our system, dubbed NeRF-W, to internet photo collections of famous landmarks, and demonstrate temporally consistent novel view renderings that are significantly closer to photorealism than the prior state of the art.","publicationTitle":"arXiv:2008.02268 [cs]","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2021-01-06","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"NeRF in the Wild","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02268","accessDate":"2021-06-20T16:03:45Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"arXiv.org","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"arXiv: 2008.02268","tags":[],"collections":["CPYKW3PF"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-06-20T16:03:45Z","dateModified":"2021-06-20T16:03:45Z"}},{"key":"F86LTWEM","version":78,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/F86LTWEM","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/F86LTWEM","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"creatorSummary":"Attal et al.","parsedDate":"2020-08-14","numChildren":3},"data":{"key":"F86LTWEM","version":78,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"MatryODShka: Real-time 6DoF Video View Synthesis using Multi-Sphere Images","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Benjamin","lastName":"Attal"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Selena","lastName":"Ling"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Aaron","lastName":"Gokaslan"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Richardt"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"James","lastName":"Tompkin"}],"abstractNote":"We introduce a method to convert stereo 360{\\deg} (omnidirectional stereo) imagery into a layered, multi-sphere image representation for six degree-of-freedom (6DoF) rendering. Stereo 360{\\deg} imagery can be captured from multi-camera systems for virtual reality (VR), but lacks motion parallax and correct-in-all-directions disparity cues. Together, these can quickly lead to VR sickness when viewing content. One solution is to try and generate a format suitable for 6DoF rendering, such as by estimating depth. However, this raises questions as to how to handle disoccluded regions in dynamic scenes. Our approach is to simultaneously learn depth and disocclusions via a multi-sphere image representation, which can be rendered with correct 6DoF disparity and motion parallax in VR. This significantly improves comfort for the viewer, and can be inferred and rendered in real time on modern GPU hardware. Together, these move towards making VR video a more comfortable immersive medium.","publicationTitle":"arXiv:2008.06534 [cs]","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2020-08-14","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"MatryODShka","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.06534","accessDate":"2021-06-20T16:03:45Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"arXiv.org","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"arXiv: 2008.06534","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-06-20T16:03:45Z","dateModified":"2021-06-20T16:03:45Z"}},{"key":"QBWKQDGW","version":59,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/QBWKQDGW","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/QBWKQDGW","type":"text/html"},"up":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/F86LTWEM","type":"application/json"}},"meta":{"numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"QBWKQDGW","version":59,"parentItem":"F86LTWEM","itemType":"note","note":"Comment: 25 pages, 13 figures, Published at European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV 2020), Project Page: http://visual.cs.brown.edu/matryodshka","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-06-20T16:03:45Z","dateModified":"2021-06-20T16:03:45Z"}},{"key":"X8EPCZV3","version":59,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/X8EPCZV3","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/X8EPCZV3","type":"text/html"},"up":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/VR6DWTNT","type":"application/json"}},"meta":{"numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"X8EPCZV3","version":59,"parentItem":"VR6DWTNT","itemType":"note","note":"Comment: Project website: https://nerf-w.github.io.

We synthesize views by querying 5D coordinates along camera rays and use classic volume rendering techniques to project the output colors and densities into an image. Because volume rendering is naturally differentiable, the only input required to optimize our representation is a set of images with known camera poses. We describe how to effectively optimize neural radiance fields to render photorealistic novel views of scenes with complicated geometry and appearance, and demonstrate results that outperform prior work on neural rendering and view synthesis.

However, current network architectures for such implicit neural representations are incapable of modeling signals with fine detail, and fail to represent a signal's spatial and temporal derivatives, despite the fact that these are essential to many physical signals defined implicitly as the solution to partial differential equations. We propose to leverage periodic activation functions for implicit neural representations and demonstrate that these networks, dubbed sinusoidal representation networks or Sirens, are ideally suited for representing complex natural signals and their derivatives. We analyze Siren activation statistics to propose a principled initialization scheme and demonstrate the representation of images, wavefields, video, sound, and their derivatives. Further, we show how Sirens can be leveraged to solve challenging boundary value problems, such as particular Eikonal equations (yielding signed distance functions), the Poisson equation, and the Helmholtz and wave equations. Lastly, we combine Sirens with hypernetworks to learn priors over the space of Siren functions.","publicationTitle":"arXiv:2006.09661 [cs, eess]","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2020-06-17","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09661","accessDate":"2021-06-20T16:03:43Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"arXiv.org","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"arXiv: 2006.09661","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-06-20T16:03:43Z","dateModified":"2021-06-20T16:03:43Z"}},{"key":"Z9RMBP5X","version":77,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/Z9RMBP5X","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/Z9RMBP5X","type":"text/html"}},"meta":{"creatorSummary":"Yariv et al.","parsedDate":"2020-10-25","numChildren":2},"data":{"key":"Z9RMBP5X","version":77,"itemType":"journalArticle","title":"Multiview Neural Surface Reconstruction by Disentangling Geometry and Appearance","creators":[{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Lior","lastName":"Yariv"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Yoni","lastName":"Kasten"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Dror","lastName":"Moran"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Meirav","lastName":"Galun"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Matan","lastName":"Atzmon"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Ronen","lastName":"Basri"},{"creatorType":"author","firstName":"Yaron","lastName":"Lipman"}],"abstractNote":"In this work we address the challenging problem of multiview 3D surface reconstruction.

Generalizing across shapes with such neural implicit representations amounts to learning priors over the respective function space and enables geometry reconstruction from partial or noisy observations. Existing generalization methods rely on conditioning a neural network on a low-dimensional latent code that is either regressed by an encoder or jointly optimized in the auto-decoder framework. Here, we formalize learning of a shape space as a meta-learning problem and leverage gradient-based meta-learning algorithms to solve this task. We demonstrate that this approach performs on par with auto-decoder based approaches while being an order of magnitude faster at test-time inference. We further demonstrate that the proposed gradient-based method outperforms encoder-decoder based methods that leverage pooling-based set encoders.","publicationTitle":"arXiv:2006.09662 [cs]","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2020-06-17","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"MetaSDF","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09662","accessDate":"2021-06-20T16:03:40Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"arXiv.org","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"arXiv: 2006.09662","tags":[],"collections":["5XFEXSAE"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-06-20T16:03:40Z","dateModified":"2021-06-20T16:03:40Z"}},{"key":"WHCX2LY5","version":57,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/WHCX2LY5","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/WHCX2LY5","type":"text/html"},"up":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/UPA65XTD","type":"application/json"}},"meta":{"numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"WHCX2LY5","version":57,"parentItem":"UPA65XTD","itemType":"note","note":"Comment: Project website: https://vsitzmann.github.io/metasdf/","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-06-20T16:03:40Z","dateModified":"2021-06-20T16:03:40Z"}},{"key":"HT896E7F","version":57,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/HT896E7F","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/HT896E7F","type":"text/html"},"up":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/ZN4Q97I6","type":"application/json"}},"meta":{"numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"HT896E7F","version":57,"parentItem":"ZN4Q97I6","itemType":"attachment","linkMode":"imported_file","title":"Sohl-Dickstein et al. -

Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) learn a continuous volumetric representation of a scene through multi-view consistency, and can be rendered from novel viewpoints by ray casting. While NeRF has an impressive ability to reconstruct geometry and fine details given many images, up to 100 for challenging 360{\\deg} scenes, it often finds a degenerate solution to its image reconstruction objective when only a few input views are available. To improve few-shot quality, we propose DietNeRF. We introduce an auxiliary semantic consistency loss that encourages realistic renderings at novel poses. DietNeRF is trained on individual scenes to (1) correctly render given input views from the same pose, and (2) match high-level semantic attributes across different, random poses. Our semantic loss allows us to supervise DietNeRF from arbitrary poses. We extract these semantics using a pre-trained visual encoder such as CLIP, a Vision Transformer trained on hundreds of millions of diverse single-view, 2D photographs mined from the web with natural language supervision. In experiments, DietNeRF improves the perceptual quality of few-shot view synthesis when learned from scratch, can render novel views with as few as one observed image when pre-trained on a multi-view dataset, and produces plausible completions of completely unobserved regions.","publicationTitle":"arXiv:2104.00677 [cs]","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2021-04-01","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"Putting NeRF on a Diet","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.00677","accessDate":"2021-04-26T04:42:06Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"arXiv.org","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"arXiv: 2104.00677","tags":[],"collections":["CPYKW3PF"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-04-26T04:42:06Z","dateModified":"2021-04-26T04:42:06Z"}},{"key":"WCX8EDFW","version":11,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/WCX8EDFW","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/WCX8EDFW","type":"text/html"},"up":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/KHSD5WHK","type":"application/json"}},"meta":{"numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"WCX8EDFW","version":11,"parentItem":"KHSD5WHK","itemType":"note","note":"<p>Comment: Project website: https://www.ajayj.com/dietnerf</p>","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-04-26T04:42:06Z","dateModified":"2021-04-26T04:41:34Z"}},{"key":"GVJSXIF3","version":362,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/GVJSXIF3","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/GVJSXIF3","type":"text/html"},"up":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/WSXPLJSX","type":"application/json"},"enclosure":{"type":"text/html","href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/GVJSXIF3/file/view"}},"meta":{"numChildren":0},"data":{"key":"GVJSXIF3","version":362,"parentItem":"WSXPLJSX","itemType":"attachment","linkMode":"imported_url","title":"arXiv.org Snapshot","accessDate":"2021-04-26T04:31:51Z","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.02190","note":"","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"2012.html","md5":"9aca628bac5ee958dbc2f50c2ccd49e6","mtime":1619411511000,"tags":[],"relations":{"owl:sameAs":"http://zotero.org/groups/4320173/items/ENI87CE3"},"dateAdded":"2021-04-26T04:31:51Z","dateModified":"2021-04-26T04:31:51Z"}},{"key":"F9DCKB7B","version":362,"library":{"type":"user","id":7902311,"name":"supasorn","links":{"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn","type":"text/html"}}},"links":{"self":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/F9DCKB7B","type":"application/json"},"alternate":{"href":"https://www.zotero.org/supasorn/items/F9DCKB7B","type":"text/html"},"up":{"href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/WSXPLJSX","type":"application/json"},"enclosure":{"type":"application/pdf","href":"https://api.zotero.org/users/7902311/items/F9DCKB7B/file/view","title":"Yu et al. -

Thus, they do not provide precise control over camera viewpoint or object pose. To address this problem, several recent approaches leverage intermediate voxel-based representations in combination with differentiable rendering. However, existing methods either produce low image resolution or fall short in disentangling camera and scene properties, e.g., the object identity may vary with the viewpoint. In this paper, we propose a generative model for radiance fields which have recently proven successful for novel view synthesis of a single scene. In contrast to voxel-based representations, radiance fields are not confined to a coarse discretization of the 3D space, yet allow for disentangling camera and scene properties while degrading gracefully in the presence of reconstruction ambiguity. By introducing a multi-scale patch-based discriminator, we demonstrate synthesis of high-resolution images while training our model from unposed 2D images alone. We systematically analyze our approach on several challenging synthetic and real-world datasets. Our experiments reveal that radiance fields are a powerful representation for generative image synthesis, leading to 3D consistent models that render with high fidelity.","publicationTitle":"arXiv:2007.02442 [cs]","volume":"","issue":"","pages":"","date":"2021-03-30","series":"","seriesTitle":"","seriesText":"","journalAbbreviation":"","language":"","DOI":"","ISSN":"","shortTitle":"GRAF","url":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.02442","accessDate":"2021-04-26T04:30:42Z","archive":"","archiveLocation":"","libraryCatalog":"arXiv.org","callNumber":"","rights":"","extra":"arXiv: 2007.02442","tags":[],"collections":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2021-04-26T04:30:42Z","dateModified":"2021-04-26T04:30:42Z"}}]
